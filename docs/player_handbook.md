## 1. Step-by-Step Characters

### Building Bruenor

OUR FIRST STEP IN PLAYING AN ADVENTURER IN THE Dungeons & Dragons game is to imagine and create a character of you r own. Your character is a combination of game statistics, roleplaying hooks, and you r imagination. You choose a race (such as human or halfling) and a class (such as fighter or wizard). You also invent the personality, appearance, and back story of you r character. Once completed, you r character serves as you r representative in the game, you r avatar in the Dungeons & Dragons world. Be for e you dive into step 1 below, think ab out the kind ofadventurer you want to play. You might be a c our ageous fighter, a skulking rogue, a fervent cleric, or a flamboyant wizard. Or you might be more interested in an unconventional character, such as a brawny rogue who likes h and-to-h and combat, or a sharpshooter who picks of f enem ies from afar. Doyou like fantasy fiction featuring dwarves or elves? Try building a character of one of those races. Doyou want you r character to be the toughest adventurer at the table? Consider a class like barbarian or paladin. If you don’t know where else to begin, take a look at the illustrations in this book to see what catches you r interest. Once you have a character in mind, follow the se steps in order, making decisions that reflect the character you want. Y our conception of you r character might evolve with each choice you make. W hat’s important is that you com e to the table with a character you’re excited to play. Through out this chapter, weuse the term character sheet to mean what ever you use to track you r character, whe the r it’safor m al character sheet (like the one at the end of this book), some for m of digital record, or a piece of not ebook paper. An of ficial D&D character sheet is a fine place to start until you know what in for mation you need and how you use it during the game. Each step ofcharacter creation includes an example of that step, with a player named Bob building his dwarf character, Bruenor. 1.

### Choosea Race

Every character belongs to a race, one of the m any intelligent humanoid species in the D&D world. The most com m on player character races are dwarves, elves, halflings, and humans. Som e races also have subraces, such as mountain dwarf or w ood elf. Chapter 2 provides more in for mation ab out the se races, as well as the less widespread races of dragonborn, gnom es, half-elves, half-orcs, and tieflings. The race you choose contributes to you r character’s identity in an important way, by establishing a general appearance and the natural talents gained from culture and ancestry. Y our character’s race grants particular racial tra its, such as special senses, proficiency with certain w eapons or tools, proficiency in one or more skills, or the ability to use minor spells. These tra its som etim es dovetail with the capabilities of certain classes (see step 2). For example, the racial tra its of lightfoot halflings make the m exceptional rogues, and high elves tend to be powerful wizards. Som etim es playing against type can be fun, too. Half-orc paladins and mountain dwarf wizards, for example, can be unusual but memorable characters. Y our race also increases one or more of you r ability scores, which you determine in step 3. Note the se increases and remember to apply the m later. Record the tra its granted by you r race on you r character sheet. Be sure to not e you r starting languages and you r base speed as well. BuildingBruenor , St e p 1 Bob is sitting down to create his character. He decides that a gruff mountain dwarf f its the character he want s to play. He not es all the racial tra its of dwarves on his character sheet, including his speed of 25 feet and the languages he know s: Com m on and Dwarvish. 2.

### Choosea Class

Every adventurer is amem ber of a class. Class broadly describes a character’s vocation, what special talents he or she possesses, and the tactics he or she is most likely to employ when exploring a dungeon, fighting monsters, or engaging in a tense negotiation. The character classes are described in chapter 3. Y our character receives a number of benef its from you r choice of class. M any of the se benef its are class features—capabilities (including spellcasting) that set you r character apart from m em bers of o the r classes. You also gain a number of proficiencies: armor, weapons, skills, saving throws, and som etim es tools. Y our proficiencies define m any ofthe things you r character can do particularly well, from using certain w eapons to telling a convincing lie. On you r character sheet, record all the features that you r class give s you at 1st level.

### Level

Typic all y, a character starts at 1st level and advances in level by adventuring and gaining experience points (XP). A 1st-level character is inexperienced in the adventuring world, although he or she might have been a soldier or a pirate and d one dangerous things be for e. Starting of f at 1st level marks you r character’s entry into the adventuring life. If you’re already familiar with the game, or if you are joining an existing D&D campaign, you r DM might decide to have you begin at a higher level, on the assumption that you r character has already survived a few harrowing adventures.

### Quick Build

Each class description in chapter 3 includes a section of fering suggestions to quickly build a character of that class, including how to assign you r highest ability scores, a back ground suitable to the class, and starting spells. PART 1 S TE P-B Y -STE P CHARACTERS Record you r level on you r character sheet. If you’re starting at a higher level, record the additional elements you r class give s you for you r levels past 1st. A lso record you r experience points. A 1st-level character has 0 XPA higher-level character typic all y begins with the minim um amount of XPrequired to r each that level (see “Beyond 1st Level” later in this chapter). HitPoints and HitD ic e Y our character’s hit points define how tough you r character is in combat and o the r dangerous situations. Y our hit points are determined by you r Hit Dice (short for Hit Point Dice).

### Ability Score Summary

Strength Measures: Natural athleticism, bodily power Im portant for: Barbarian, fighter, paladin Racial Increases: Mountain dwarf (+2) Half-orc (+2) Dragonborn (+2) Human (+1) Dexterity Measures: Physical agility, reflexes, balance, poise Im portant for: Monk, ranger, rogue Racial Increases: Elf (+2) Forest gnome (+1) Halfling (+2) Human (+1) Constitution Measures: Health, stamina, vital for ce Im portant for: Every one Racial Increases: Dwarf (+2) Half-orc (+1) St out halfling (+1) Human (+1) Rock gnome (+1) Intelligence Measures: Mental acuity, in for mation rec all, analytical skill Im portant for: Wizard Racial Increases: High elf (+1) Tiefling (+1) Gnome (+2) Human (+1) Wisdom Measures: Aw are ness, intuition, insight Im portant for: Cleric, druid Racial Increases: Hill dwarf (+1) Human (+1) Wood elf (+1) Charisma Measures: Confidence, eloquence, leadership Im portant for: Bard, sorcerer, warlock Racial Increases: Half-elf (+2) Dragonborn (+1) Drow (+1) Human (+1) Lightfoot halfling (+1) Tiefling (+2) At 1st level, you r character has 1 Hit Die, and the die type is determined by you r class. You start with hit points equal to the highest roll of that die, as indicated in you r class description. (You also add you r Constitution modifier, which you’ll determine in step 3.) This is also you r hit point maximum. R ecord you r character’s hit points on you r character sheet. Also record the type ofHit Die you r character use s and the number of Hit D ice you have. After you rest, you can spend Hit D ice to regain hit points (see “Resting” in chapter 8).

### Proficiency Bonus

The table that appears in you r class description s how s you r proficiency bonus, which is +2 for a 1st-level character. Y our proficiency bonus applies to m any of the numbers you’ll be recording on you r character sheet: • Attack rolls using w eapons you’re proficient with • Attack rolls with spells you cast • Ability checks using skills you’re proficient in • Ability checks using tools you’re proficient with • Saving throws you’re proficient in • Saving throw DCs for spells you cast (explained in each spellcasting class) Y our class determines you r w eapon proficiencies, you r saving throw proficiencies, and some of you r skill and tool proficiencies. (Skills are described in chapter 7, tools in chapter 5.) Y our back ground give s you additional skill and tool proficiencies, and some races give you more proficiencies. Be sure to not e all ofthese proficiencies, as well as you r proficiency bonus, on you r character sheet. Y our proficiency bonus can’t be added to a single die roll or o the r num ber more than once. Occasion all y, you r proficiency bonus might be modified (doubled or halved, for example) be for e you apply it. If a circum stance suggests that you r proficiency bonus applies more than once to the sam e roll or that it should be multiplied more than once, you never the less add it only once, multiply it only once, and halve it only once. BuildingBruenor , St e p 2 Bob im agines Bruenor charging into battle with an axe, one horn on his helmet broken of f. He make s Bruenor a fighter and not es the fighter’s proficiencies and 1st-level class features on his character sheet. As a 1st-level fighter, Bruenor has 1 Hit Die—a d 10— and starts with hit points equal to 10 + his Constitution modifier. Bob not es this, and will record the final number after he determines Bruenor’s Constitution score (see step 3). Bob also not es the proficiency bonus for a 1st-level character, which is +2. 3 .

### Determine Ability Scores

Much of what you r character does in the game depends on his or her six abilities: Strength, Dexterity, Constitution, Intelligence, Wisdom, and Charisma. Each ability has a score, which is a num ber you record on you r character sheet. The six abilities and the ir use in the game are described in chapter 7. The Ability S core Sum m ary table provides a quick reference for what qualities are m easured by each ability, what races increases which abilities, and what classes consider each ability particularly important. You generate you r character's six ability scores r and omly. Roll f our 6-sided dice and record the total of the highest three dice on a piece of scratch paper. Do this five more time s, so that you have six numbers. If you want to save time or don’t like the idea of r and omly determining ability scores, you can use the following scores instead: 15, 14, 13, 12, 10, 8. Now take you r six num bers and write each number beside one ofyour character’s six abilities to assign scores to Strength, Dexterity, Constitution, Intelligence, W isdom , and Charisma. Afterward, make any changes to you r ability scores as a result of you r race choice. After assigning you r ability scores, determine you r ability modifiers using the Ability Scores and M odifiers table. To determine an ability modifier with out consulting the table, subtract 10 from the ability score and the n divide the result by 2 (round down). Write the modifier next to each of you r scores. BuildingBruenor , St e p 3 Bob decides to use the st and ard set of scores (15, 14, 13, 12, 10, 8) for Bruenor’s abilities. Since he’safighter, he puts his highest score, 15, in Strength. His next- highest, 14, goes in Constitution. Bruenor might be a brash fighter, but Bob decides he want s the dwarf to be older, wiser, and a good leader, so he puts decent scores in W isdom and Charisma. After applying his racial benef its (increasing Bruenor’s Constitution by 2 and his Strength by 2), Bruenor’s ability scores and modifiers look like this: Strength 17 (+3), Dexterity 10 (+0), Constitution 16 (+3), Intelligence 8 (-1), W isdom 13 (+1), Charisma 12 (+1). Bob fills in Bruenor's final hit points: 10 + his Constitution m odifier of +3, for a total of 13 hit points. Variant : CustomizingAbilityScores At you r Dungeon Master’s option, you can use this variant for determining you r ability scores. The method described here all ows you to build a character with a set of ability scores you choose individu all y. You have 27 points to spend on you r ability scores. The cost of each score is s how n on the Ability Score Point Cost table. For example, a score of 14 costs 7 points. Using this method, 15 is the highest ability score you can end up with, be for e applying racial increases. You can’t have a score lower than 8. This method of determining ability scores enables you to create a set ofthree high numbers and three low one s (15, 15, 15, 8, 8, 8), a set ofnumbers that are above

### Ability Score Point Cost

### Describe Your Character

Once you know the basic game aspects of you r character, it’s time to flesh him or her out as a person. Y our character needs a name. Spend a few minutes think ing ab out what he or she look s like and how he or she be have s in general terms. Using the in for mation in chapter 4, you can flesh out you r character’s physical appearance and personality tra its. Choose you r character’s alignment (the moral com pass that guides his or her decisions) and ideals. Chapter 4 also helps you identify the things you r character holds m ost dear, c all ed bonds, and the flaws that could one day undermine him or her. Y our character’s back ground describes where he or she cam e from, his or her original occupation, and the character’s place in the D&D world. Y our DM might of fer additional back grounds beyond the one s included Score Cost Score Cost 8 0 12 4 9 1 13 5 10 2 14 7 11 3 15 9 in chapter 4, and might be will ing to w ork with you to craft a back ground that’sam ore precise fit for you r character concept. A back ground give s you r character a back ground feature (a general benefit) and proficiency in two skills, and it might also give you additional languages or proficiency with certain kinds of tools. R ecord this in for mation, along with the personality in for mation you develop, on you r character sheet. Y our Character ’sAbilities Take you r character’s ability scores and race into account as you flesh out his or her appearance and personality. A very strong character with low Intelligence might think and be have very differently from a very smart character with low Strength. For example, high Strength usu all y corresponds with a burly or athletic body, while a character with low Strength might be scrawny or plump. A character with high Dexterity is probably li the and slim, while a character with low Dexterity might be ei the r gangly and awkward or heavy and thick-fingered. A character with high Constitution usu all y look s healthy, with bright eyes and abundant energy. A character with low Constitution might be sickly or frail. A character with high Intelligence might be highly inquisitive and studious, while a character with low Intelligence might speak simply or easily for get details. A character with high W isdom has good judgment, empathy, and a general aw are ness of what’s going on. A character with low W isdom might be absent-minded, foolhardy, or oblivious. A character with high Charisma exudes confidence, which is usu all y mixed with a graceful or intimidating presence. A character with a low Charisma might com e across as abrasive, inarticulate, or timid. BuildingBruenor , St e p 4 B ob fills in some of Bruenor’s basic details: his name, his sex (male), his height and weight, and his alignment (lawful good). His high Strength and Constitution suggest a healthy, athletic body, and his low Intelligence suggests a degree of for get fulness. Bob decides that Bruenor com es from a noble line, but his clan was expelled from its homel and when Bruenor was very you ng. He grew up working as a smith in the remote villages of Icewind Dale. But Bruenor has a heroic destiny—to reclaim his homel and—so Bob chooses the folk hero back ground for his dwarf. He not es the proficiencies and special feature this back ground give s him. Bob has a pretty clear picture of Bruenor’s personality in mind, so he skips the personality tra its suggested in the folk hero back ground, not ing instead that Bruenor is a caring, sensitive dwarf who genuinely loves his friends and all ies, but he hides this soft heart behind a gruff, snarling demeanor. He chooses the ideal of fairness from the list in his back ground, not ing that Bruenor believes that no one is above the law. Given his history, Bruenor’s bond is obvious: he aspires to some day reclaim Mithral H all, his homel and, from the shadow dragon that drove the dwarves out. His flaw is tied to his caring, sensitive nature—he has a soft spot for orphans and way ward souls, leading him to s how m ercy even when it might not be warranted. 5 .

### Choose Equipment

Y our class and back ground determine you r character's starting equipment, including weapons, armor, and o the r adventuring gear. R ecord this equipment on you r character sheet. All such items are detailed in chapter 5. Instead of taking the gear give n to you by you r class and back ground, you can purc has e you r starting equipment. You have a num ber of gold pieces (gp) to spend based on you r class, as s how n in chapter 5. Extensive lists of equipment, with prices, also appear in that chapter. If you wish, you can also have one trinket at no cost (see the trinket table at the end ofchapter 5). Y our Strength score lim its the amount ofgear you can carry. Try not to purc has e equipment with a total weight (in pounds) exceeding you r Strength score time s 15. Chapter 7 has more in for mation on carrying capacity.

### Armor Class

Y our Armor Class (AC) represents how well you r character avoids being wounded in battle. Things that contribute to you r AC include the armor you wear, the shield you carry, and you r Dexterity modifier. Not all characters w ear armor or carry shields, how ever. With out armor or a shield, you r character’s AC equals 10 + his or her Dexterity modifier. If you r character wears armor, carries a shield, or both, calculate you r AC using the rules in chapter 5. R ecord you r AC on you r character sheet. Y our character needs to be proficient with armor and shields to w ear and use the m effectively, and you r armor and shield proficiencies are determined by you r class. There are draw back s to wearing armor or carrying a shield if you lack the required proficiency, as explained in chapter 5. Som e spells and class features give you a different way to calculate you r AC. If you have multiple features that give you different way s to calculate you r AC, you choose which one to use.

### Weapons

For each weapon you r character wields, calculate the modifier you use when you attack with the w eapon and the damage you deal when you hit. W hen you make an attack with a weapon, you roll a d20 and add you r proficiency bonus (but only if you are proficient with the weapon) and the appropriate ability modifier. • For attacks with melee weapons, use you r Strength m odifier for attack and damage rolls. A weapon that has the finesse property, such as a rapier, can use you r Dexterity modifier instead. • For attacks with ranged weapons, use you r Dexterity modifier for attack and damage rolls. Aweapon that has the thrown property, such as ahand axe, can use you r Strength modifier instead. BuildingBruenor , St e p 5 Bob writes down the starting equipment from the fighter class and the folk hero back ground. His starting equipment includes chain mail and a shield, which com bine to give Bruenor an Arm or Class of 18. For Bruenor’sweapons, Bob chooses a battleaxe and two h and axes. His battleaxe is a melee weapon, so Bruenor use s his Strength modifier for his attacks and damage. His attack bonus is his Strength modifier (+3) plus his proficiency bonus (+2), for a total of +5. The battleaxe deals 1d8 slashing damage, and Bruenor adds his Strength modifier to the damage when he h its, for a total of 1d8 + 3 slashing damage. W hen throwing ahand axe, Bruenor has the same attack bonus (h and axes, as thrown weapons, use Strength for attacks and damage), and the weapon deals 1d6 + 3 slashing damage when it h its. 6. C omeToge the r Most D&D characters don’t work al one. Each character plays a role with in a party, a group of adventurers working toge the r for a com m on purpose. Teamwork and cooperation greatly improve you r party’s chances to survive the m any perils in the worlds of Dungeons & Dragons . Talk to you r fellow players and you r DM to decide whe the r you r characters know one an o the r, how the y met, and what sorts of quests the group might under take. Beyond 1st Level As you r character goes on adventures and over com es ch all enges, he or she gains experience, represented by experience points. A character w ho r each es a specified experience point total advances in capability. This advancement is c all ed gaining a level. W hen you r character gains a level, his or her class of ten grants additional features, as detailed in the class description. Som e of the se features all ow you to increase you r ability scores, ei the r increasing two scores by 1 each or increasing one score by 2. You can’t increase an ability score above 20. In addition, every character’s proficiency bonus increases at certain levels. Each time you gain a level, you gain 1 additional Hit Die. Roll that Hit Die, add you r Constitution modifier to the roll, and add the total to you r hit point maximum. Alternatively, you can use the fixed value s how n in you r class entry, which is the average result of the die roll (rounded up). W hen you r Constitution modifier increases by 1, you r hit point maximum increases by 1 for each level you have attained. For example, when Bruenor r each es 8th level as a fighter, he increases his Constitution score from 17 to 18, thus increasing his Constitution modifier from +3 to +4. His hit point maximum the n increases by 8. The Character Advancement table sum m arizes the XPyou need to advance in levels from level 1 through level 20, and the proficiency bonus for a character of that level. Consult the in for mation in you r character’s class description to see what o the r improvements you gain at each level.

### Tiersof Play

The shading in the Character Advancement table s how s the f our tiers of play. The tiers don’t have any rules associated with the m; the y are a general description of how the play experience changes as characters gain levels. In the first tier (levels 1-4), characters are effectively apprentice adventurers. They are learning the features that define the m as m em bers of particular classes, including the major choices that flavor the ir class features as the y advance (such as a wizard’s Ar can e Tradition or a fighter’s Martial Archetype). The threats the y face are relatively minor, usu all y posing a danger to local farmsteads or villages. In the second tier (levels 5-10), characters com e into the ir own. M any spellcasters gain access to 3rd-level spells at the start of this tier, crossing a new threshold of magical power with spells such as fireb all and lightning bolt. At this tier, m any weapon-using classes gain the ability to make multiple attacks in one round. These characters have becom e important, facing dangers that threaten cities and kingdoms. In the third tier (levels 11-16), characters have r each ed a level of power that sets the m high above the ordinary populace and make s the m special even am ong adventurers. At 11th level, m any spellcasters gain access to 6th-level spells, some of which create effects previously im possible for player characters to achieve. O the r characters gain features that all ow the m to make more attacks or do more impressive things with those attacks. These mighty adventurers of ten confront threats to who le regions and continents. At the f our th tier (levels 17-20), characters achieve the pinnacle of the ir class features, becom ing heroic (or villainous) archetypes in the ir own right. The fate of the world or even the fundamental order of the multiverse might hang in the balance during the ir adventures.

## 2. Races

### Racial Tr

A VISIT TO ONE OF THE GREAT CITIES IN THE worlds of Dungeons & Dragons — Waterdeep, the Free City of Greyhawk, or even un can ny Sigil, the City of D oors— over whelms the senses. Voices chatter in countless different languages. The smells of cooking in dozens ofdifferent cuisines mingle with the odors of crow ded streets and poor sanitation. Buildings in myriad architectural styles display the diverse origins of the ir inhabitants. And the people the m selves—people of varying size, shape, and color, dressed in a dazzling spectrum of styles and hues—represent m any different races, from diminutive halflings and st out dwarves to majestic all y beautiful elves, mingling am ong a variety of human ethnicities. Scattered am ong the m em bers of the se more com m on races are the true exotics: a hulking dragonborn here, pushing his way through the crowd, and a sly tiefling the re, lurking in the shadows with m ischief in her eyes. A group ofgnom es laughs as one of the m activates a clever w ooden toy that m oves of its own accord. Half- elves and half-orcs live and work alongside humans, with out fully belonging to the races of ei the r of the ir p are nts. And the re, well out of the sunlight, is alone drow—a fugitive from the subterranean expanse of the Underdark, trying to make his way in a world that fears his kind. Choosinga Race Humans are the m ost com m on people in the w orlds of D&D, but the y live and work alongside dwarves, elves, halflings, and countless o the r fantastic species. Your character belongs to one of the se peoples. Not every intelligent race of the multiverse is appropriate for a player-controlled adventurer. Dwarves, elves, halflings, and humans are the m ost com m on races to produce the sort of adventurers w ho make up typical parties. Dragonborn, gnom es, half-elves, half- orcs, and tieflings are less com m on as adventurers. Drow, a subrace of elves, are also uncom m on. Y our choice ofrace affects m any different aspects of you r character. It establishes fundamental qualities that exist through out you r character’s adventuring c are er. W hen making this decision, keep in mind the kind of character you want to play. For example, a halfling could be a good choice for a sneaky rogue, a dwarf make s a tough warrior, and an elf can be a master of ar can e magic. Y our character race not only affects you r ability scores and tra its but also provides the cues for building you r character’s story. Each race’s description in this chapter includes in for mation to help you roleplay a character of that race, including personality, physical appearance, features ofsociety, and racial alignment tendencies. These details are suggestions to help you think ab out you r character; adventurers can deviate widely from the norm for the ir race. It’s worthwhile to consider why you r character is different, as a helpful way to think ab out you r character’s back ground and personality. a i t s The description of each race includes racial tra its that are com m on to m em bers of that race. The following entries appear am ong the tra its of most races.

### Ability Score Increase

Every race increases one or more of a character’s ability scores.

### Age

The age entry not es the age when amem ber ofthe race is considered an adult, as well as the race’s expected lifespan. This in for mation can help you decide how old you r character is at the start of the game. You can choose any age for you r character, which could provide an explanation for some of you r ability scores. For example, if you play a you ng or very old character, you r age could explain a particularly low Strength or Constitution score, while advanced age could account for a high Intelligence or W isdom .

### Alignment

Most races have tendencies toward certain alignments, described in this entry. These are not binding for player characters, but considering why you r dwarf is chaotic, for example, in defiance of lawful dwarf society can help you better define you r character. S iz e Characters of most races are Medium, a size category including creatures that are roughly 4 to 8 feet t all. M embers of a few races are Sm all (between 2 and 4 feet t all), which means that certain rules of the game affect the m differently. The m ost important ofthese rules is that Sm all characters have trouble w ielding heavy weapons, as explained in chapter 6.

### Speed

Y our speed determines how far you can move when traveling (chapter 8) and fighting (chapter 9).

### Languages

By virtue of you r race, you r character can speak, read, and write certain languages. Chapter 4 lists the most com m on languages of the D&D multiverse. Su braces Som e races have subraces. M em bers of a subrace have the tra its of the p are nt race in addition to the tra its specified for the ir subrace. Relationships am ong subraces vary signifi can tly from race to race and world to world. In the Dragonlance cam paign setting, for example, mountain dwarves and hill dwarves live toge the r as different clans of the sam e people, but in the Forgotten Realms, the y live far apart in separate kingdom s and c all the mselves shield dwarves and gold dwarves, respectively.

### Shortand

### Stout

Bold and hardy, dwarves are know n as skilled warriors, miners, and workers of st one and metal. Though the y st and well under 5 feet t all, dwarves are so broad and compact that the y can weigh as much as a human st and ing nearly two feet t all er. Their c our age and endurance are also easily a match for any of the larger folk. Dwarven skin ranges from deep brown to a paler hue tinged with red, but the most com m on shades are light brown or deep tan, like certain t one s of earth. Their hair, worn long but in simple styles, is usu all y black, gray, or brown, though paler dwarves of ten have red hair. Male dwarves value the ir beards highly and groom the mcare fully. LongMemory , LongGrudges Dwarves can live to be more than 400 years old, so the oldest living dwarves of ten rem em ber a very different world. For example, some of the oldest dwarves living in Citadel Felbarr (in the world of the Forgotten Realms) can rec all the day, more than three centuries ago, when orcs conquered the for tress and drove the m into an exile that lasted over 250 years. This longevity grants the m a perspective on the world that shorter-lived races such as humans and halflings lack. Dwarves are solid and enduring like the mountains the y love, wea the ring the passage of centuries with stoic endurance and little change. They respect the traditions of the ir clans, tracing the ir ancestry back to the founding ofthe ir m ost ancient strongholds in the you th of the world, and don't ab and on those traditions lightly. Part of those traditions is devotion to the gods of the dwarves, w ho uphold the dwarven ideals of industrious labor, skill in battle, and devotion to the for ge. Individual dwarves are determined and loyal, true to the ir w ord and decisive in action, som etim es to the point of stubbornness. M any dwarves have a strong sense Kingdom s rich in ancient gr and eur, h all s carved into the roots of mountains, the echoing of picks and hamm ers in deep mines and blazing for ges, a commitment to clan and tradition, and a burning hatred of goblins and orc s—the se com m on threads unite all dwarves. “Yerlate , elf !” came the roughedgeofafam il ia r voice. Bruenor Battlehammer walked up the back of his dead foe, disregarding the fact that the heavy monster lay on top of his elven friend. In spite of the added discom for t, the dwarf’s long, pointed, of ten-broken nose and gray- streaked though still-fiery red beard came as a wel come sight to Drizzt. “K new I’d find ye in trouble if I came out an' look ed for ye!" —R. A . Salvatore, The Crystal Shard

### Dwarf

ofjust ice, and the y are slow to for get w rongs the y have suffered. Awrong d one to one dwarf is awrong d one to the dwarf’s entire clan, so what begins as one dwarf’s hunt for vengeance can becom eafull-blown clan feud.

### Clansand Kingdoms

Dwarven kingdom s stretch deep beneath the mountains where the dwarves mine gems and precious metals and for ge items of wonder. They love the beauty and artistry of precious metals and fine jewelry, and in some dwarves this love festers into avarice. Whatever wealth the y can’t find in the ir mountains, the y gain through trade. They dislike boats, so enterprising humans and halflings frequently h and le trade in dwarven goods along water r out es. Trus two rthy m em bers of o the r races are w elcom e in dwarf settlements, though some are as are of f lim its even to the m. The chief unit of dwarven society is the clan, and dwarves highly value social st and ing. Even dwarves who live far from the ir own kingdom s cherish the ir clan identities and affiliations, recognize related dwarves, and invoke the ir ancestors’ names in oaths and curses. To be clanless is the worst fate that can bef all a dwarf. Dwarves in o the rland s are typic all y artisans, especi all y weaponsm iths, ar more rs, and jewelers. Som e becom emercenaries or bodyguards, highly sought after for the ir c our age and loyalty. Gods , Gold , and Clan Dwarves w ho take up the adventuring life might be motivated by a desire for treasure—for its own sake, for a specific purpose, or even out of an altruistic desire to help o the r s. O the r dwarves are driven by the com m and or inspiration of a deity, a direct c all ing or simply a desire to bring glory to one of the dwarf gods. Clan and ancestry are also important motivators. A dwarf might see k to restore a clan’s lost honor, avenge an ancient wrong the clan suffered, or earn a new place with in the clan after having been exiled. Or a dwarf might search for the axe w ielded by a mighty ancestor, lost on the field of battle centuries ago.

### Slowto Trust

Dwarves get along passably well with most o the r races. “The difference between an acquaintance and a friend is ab out a hundred years,” is a dwarf saying that might be hyperbole, but certainly points to how difficult it can be for a member of a short-lived race like humans to earn a dwarf’s trust. Elves. “ It’s not wise to depend on the elves. No telling what an elf will do next; when the hammer meets the orc’s head, the y’re as apt to start singing as to pull out a sword. They’re flighty and frivolous. Two things to be said for the m, though: They don’t have m any smiths, but the one s the y have do very fine work. And when orcs or goblins come streaming down out of the mountains, an elf’s good to have at you r back. Not as good as a dwarf, may be, but no doubt the y hate the orcs as much as we do.” Halflings. “Sure, the y’re pleasant folk. But s how me a halfling hero. An empire, a triumphant army. Even a treasure for the ages made by halfling h and s. Nothing. How can you take the m seriously?” Humans. “You take the time to get to know a human, and by the n the human’s on her deathbed. If you’re lucky, she’s got kin— a daughter or gr and daughter, may be— who’s got h and s and heart as good as hers. That’s when you can make a human friend. And watch the m go! They set the ir hearts on some thing, the y’ll get it, whe the r it’sadragon’s hoard or an empire’s thr one. You have to admire that kind of dedication, even if it get s the m in trouble more of ten than not.”

### Dwarf Names

A dwarf’s name is granted by a clan elder, in accordance with tradition. Every proper dwarven name has been use d and re use d down through the generations. A dw arf’s name belongs to the clan, not to the individual. A dwarf w ho m is use s or brings shame to a clan name is stripped of the name and for bidden by law to use any dwarven name in its place. Male Names: Adrik, Alberich, Baern, B are ndd, Brottor, Bruenor, Dain, Darrak, Delg, Eberk, Einkil, Fargrim, Flint, Gardain, Harbek, Kildrak, Morgran, Orsik, Oskar, Rangrim, Rurik, Taklinn, Thoradin, Thorin, Tordek, Traubon, Travok, Ulfgar, Veit, Vondal Female Names: Amber, Artin, Audhild, Bardryn, Dagnal, Diesa, Eldeth, Falkrunn, Finellen, Gunnloda, Gurdis, Helja, Hlin, Kathra, Kristryd, Ilde, Liftrasa, Mardred, Riswynn, Sannl, Torbera, Torgga, Vistra Clan Names: Balderk, Battlehammer, Brawnanvil, Dankil, Fire for ge, Frostbeard, Gorunn, Holderhek, Ironfist, Loderr, Lutgehr, Rumnaheim, Strakeln, Torunn, Ungart

### Hill Dwarf

Dwarven Armor Training. You have proficiency with light and medium armor.

### Duergar

In cities deep in the Underdark live the duergar, or gray dwarves. These vicious, stealthy slave traders raid the surface world for captives, the n sell the ir prey to the o the r races of the Underdark. They have innate magical abilities to be come invisible and to temporarily grow to giant size. E lf “I HAVE NEVER IMAGINED SUCH BEAUTY EXISTED,” Goldmoon said softly. The day’s march had been difficult, but the reward at the end was beyond the ir dreams. The companions stood on a high cliff over the fabled city of Qualinost. F our slender spires rose from the city’s corners like glisten- ing spindles, the ir brilliant white st one marbled with shining silver. Graceful arches, swooping from spire to spire, so are d through the air. Crafted by ancient dwarven metalsmiths, the y were strong enough to hold the weight of an army, yet the y appe are d so delicate that a bird lighting on the m might over throw the balance. These glistening arches were the city’s only boundaries; the re was no w all around Qualinost. The elven city opened its arms lovingly to the wilderness. —M arg are tWeis & Tracy H ickm an, Dragons of Autumn Twilight Elves are a magical people of o the r worldly grace, living in the world but not entirely part of it. They live in places of e the real beauty, in the midst of ancient for ests or in silvery spires glittering with faerie light, where soft music drifts through the air and gentle fragrances waft on the breeze. Elves love nature and magic, art and artistry, music and poetry, and the good things of the world.

### Slenderand Graceful

With the ir unearthly grace and fine features, elves appear hauntingly beautiful to humans and mem bers of m any o the r races. They are slightly shorter than humans on average, ranging from well under 5 feet t all to just over 6 feet. They are more slender than humans, weighing only 100 to 145 pounds. Males and females are ab out the same height, and males are only margin all y heavier than females. Elves’ coloration encom passes the normal human range and also includes skin in shades of copper, bronze, and al most bluish-white, hair of green or blue, and eyes like pools of liquid gold or silver. Elves have no facial and little body hair. They favor elegant clothing in bright colors, and the y enjoy simple yet lovely jewelry. ATimelessPerspective Elves can live well over 700 years, giving the mabroad perspective on even ts that might trouble the shorter- lived races more deeply. They are more of ten am use d than excited, and more likely to be curious than greedy. They tend to remain aloof and unfazed by petty happenstance. W hen pursuing a goal, how ever, whe the r adventuring on a mission or learning a new skill or art, elves can be foc use d and relentless. They are slow to make friends and enemies, and even slower to for get the m. They reply to petty insults with disdain and to serious insults with vengeance. Like the branches of a you ng tree, elves are flexible in the face of danger. They trust in diplomacy and com prom ise to resolve differences be for e the y escalate to violence. They have been know n to retreat from intrusions into the ir w oodl and homes, confident that the y can simply wait the invaders out. But when the need arises, elves reveal a stern martial side, demonstrating skill with sword, bow, and strategy.

### Hidden Woodland Realms

Most elves d well in sm all for est villages hidden am ong the trees. Elves hunt game, ga the r food, and grow ve get ables, and the ir skill and magic all ow the m to support the mselves with out the need for clearing and plowing l and. They are talented artisans, crafting finely worked clo the s and art objects. Their contact with out siders is usu all y limited, though a few elves make a good living by trading crafted items for metals (which the y have no interest in mining). Elves encountered out side the ir own l and s are com m only traveling minstrels, artists, or sages. Human nobles com pete for the services of elf instructors to t each swordplay or magic to the ir children.

### Explorationand Adventure

Elves take up adventuring out of w and erlust. Since the y are so long-lived, the y can enjoy centuries of exploration and disc over y. They dislike the pace of human society, which is regimented from day to day but constantly changing over decades, so the y find c are ers that let the m travel freely and set the ir own pace. Elves also enjoy exercising the ir martial prowess or gaining greater magical power, and adventuring all ows the m to do so. Som e might join with rebels fighting against oppression, and o the rsmight becom e champions of moral ca use s.

### Elf Names

Elves are considered children until the y decl are the mselves adults, some time after the hundredth birth day, and be for e this period the y are c all ed by child names. On declaring adulthood, an elf selects an adult name, although those w ho k new him or her as a you ngster might continue to use the child name. Each elf’s adult name is a unique creation, though it might reflect the names ofrespected individuals or o the r family mem bers. Little distinction exists between male names and female names; the groupings here reflect only general tendencies. In addition, every elf bears a family name, typic all yacom bination of o the r Elvish words. Som e elves traveling am ong humans translate the ir family names into Com m on, but o the rsretain the Elvish version. Child Names: Ara, Bryn, Del, Eryn, Faen, Innil. Lael, Mella, Naill, Naeris, Phann, Rael, Rinn, Sai, Syllin, Thia, V all Male Adult Names: Adran, Aelar, Aramil, Arannis, Aust, Beiro, Berrian, Carric , Enialis, Erdan, Erevan, Galinndan, Hadarai, Heian, Himo, Immeral, Ivellios, Laucian, Mindartis, Paelias, Peren, Quarion, Riardon, Rolen, Soveliss, Thamior, Tharivol, Theren, Varis

### Haughtybut Gracious

Although the y can be haughty, elves are gener all y gracious even to those who f all short of the ir high expectations— which is most non-elves. Still, the y can find good in just ab out any one. Dwarves. “ Dwarves are dull, clumsy oafs. But what the y lack in humor, sophistication, and manners, the y make up in valor. And I must admit, the ir best smiths produce art that approaches elven quality.” Halflings. “ Halflings are people of simple pleasures, and that is not a quality to scorn. They’re good folk, the ycare for each o the r and tend the ir gardens, and the y have proven the mselves tougher than the y see m when the need arises." Humans. “All that has te, the ir ambition and drive to accomplish some thing be for e the ir brief lives pass a way— human endeavors see m so futile some time s. But the n you look at what the y have accomplished, and you have to appreciate the ir achievements. If only the y could slow down and learn some refinement.” Female Adult Names: Adrie, Althaea, Anastrianna, Andraste, Antinua, Bethrynna, Birel, Caelynn, Drusilia, Enna, Felosial, Ielenia, Jelenneth, Keyleth, Leshanna, Lia, Meriele, Mialee, Naivara, Quelenna, Quilla the, Sariel, Shanairra, Shava, Silaqui, Theirastra, Thia, Vadania, Valan the, Xanaphia Family Names (Common Translations): Amakiir (Gemflower), Amastacia (Starflower), Galanodel (M oonwhisper), Holimion (Diamonddew), Ilphelkiir (Gemblossom), Liadon (Silverfrond), Meliamne (Oakenheel), Nai'lo (Nightbreeze), Siannodel (M oonbrook), Xiloscient (Goldpetal)

### Elf Traits

Y our elf character has a variety ofnatural abilities, the result ofthous and sof years of elven refinement. Ability Score Increase. Y our Dexterity score increases by 2. Age. Although elves r each physical maturity at ab out the sam e age as humans, the elven underst and ing of adulthood goes beyond physical growth to encom pass worldly experience. An elf typic all y claim s adulthood and an adult name around the age of 100 and can live to be 750 years old. Alignment. Elves love freedom, variety, and self- expression, so the y lean strongly toward the gentler aspects of chaos. They value and protect o the r s' freedom as well as the ir own, and the y are more of ten good than not. The drow are an exception; the ir exile into the Underdark has made the m vicious and dangerous. D row are more of ten evil than not. Size. Elves range from under 5 to over 6 feet t all and have slender builds. Y our size is Medium. Speed. Y our base walking speed is 30 feet. Darkvision. Accustom ed to twilit for ests and the night sky, you have superior vision in dark and dim conditions. You can see in dim light with in 60 feet of you as if it were bright light, and in darkness as if it were dim light. You can’t discern color in darkness, only shades of gray. Keen Senses. You have proficiency in the Perception skill. Fey Ancestry. You have advantage on saving throws against being charmed, and magic can’t put you to sleep. Trance. Elves don’t need to sleep. Instead, the y meditate deeply, remaining sem iconscious, for 4 h our saday. (The Com m on word for such meditation is “trance.”) W hile meditating, you can dream after a fashion; such dream s are actu all y mental exercises that have becom e reflexive through years of practice. After resting in this way, you gain the sam e benefit that a human does from 8 h our s of sleep. Languages. You can speak, read, and write Com m on and Elvish. Elvish is fluid, with subtle into nations and intricate grammar. Elven literature is rich and varied, and the ir songs and poem s are famous am ong o the r races. M any bards learn the ir language so the y can add Elvish b all ads to the ir repertoires. Subrace. Ancient divides am ong the elven people resulted in three main subraces: high elves, w ood elves, and dark elves, who are com m only c all ed drow. Choose one of the se subraces. In some worlds, the se subraces are divided still fur the r (such as the sun elves and m oon elves of the Forgotten Realms), so if you wish, you can choose a narrower subrace.

### High Elf

As a high elf, you have a keen mind and a mastery of at least the basics of magic. In m any of the worlds of D&D, the re are two kinds of high elves. One type (which includes the gray elves and v all ey elves of Greyhawk, the Silvanesti of Dragonlance, and the sun elves of the Forgotten Realms) is haughty and reclusive, believing the mselves to be superior to non-elves and even o the r elves. The o the r type (including the high elves of Greyhawk. the Qualinesti of Dragonlance, and the m oon elves of the Forgotten Realms) are more com m on and more friendly, and of ten encountered am ong humans and o the r races. The sun elves of Faerun (also c all ed gold elves or sunrise elves) have bronze skin and hair of copper, black, or golden blond. Their eyes are golden, silver, or black. M oon elves (also c all ed silver elves or gray elves) are much paler, with alabaster skin som etim es tinged with blue. They of ten have hair of silver-white, black, or blue, but various shades of blond, brown, and red are not uncom m on. Their eyes are blue or green and flecked with gold. Ability Score Increase.

### Wood Elf

As awood elf, you have keen senses and intuition, and you r fleet feet carry you quickly and stealthily through you r native for ests. This category includes the wild elves (grugach) of Greyhawk and the Kag one sti of Dragonlance, as well as the races c all ed w ood elves in Greyhawk and the Forgotten Realms. In Faerun, w ood elves (also c all ed wild elves, green elves, or for est elves) are reclusive and distrusting ofnon-elves. W ood elves’ skin tends to be copperish in hue, som etim es with traces of green. Their hair tends toward browns and blacks, but it is occasion all y blond or copper-colored.

You can attempt to hide even when you are only lightly obscured by foliage, heavy rain, f all ing snow, mist, and o the r natural phenomena.

### The Darknessofthe Drow

Were it not for one renowned exception, the race of drow would be univers all y reviled. To most, the y are a race of demon-worshiping marauders d well ing in the subterranean depths of the Underdark, emerging only on the blackest nights to pillage and slaughter the surface d well ers the y despise. Their society is depraved and preoccupied with the favor of Lolth, the ir spider-goddess, who sanctions murder and the extermination of entire families as noble ho use s vie for position. Yet one drow, at least, broke the mold. In the world of the Forgotten Realms, Drizzt Do'Urden, ranger of the North, has proven his quality as a good-hearted defender of the weak and innocent. Rejecting his heritage and adrift in a world that look s upon him with terror and loathing, Drizzt is a model for those few drow who follow in his footsteps, trying to find a life apart from the evil society of the ir Underdark homes. Drow grow up believing that surface-d well ing races are inferior, worthless except as slaves. Drow who develop a conscience or find it necessary to cooperate with members of o the r races find it hard to over come that prejudice, especi all y when the y are so of ten on the receiving end of hatred. DarkElf ( Drow ) D escended from an earlier subrace of dark-skinned elves, the drow were banished from the surface world for following the goddess Lolth down the path to evil and corruption. Now the y have built the ir own civilization in the depths of the Underdark, patterned after the Way of Lolth. Also c all ed dark elves, the drow have black skin that resem bles polished obsidian and stark white or pale yellow hair. They com m only have very pale eyes (so pale as to be mis take n for white) in shades of lilac, silver, pink, red, and blue. They tend to be sm all er and thinner than m ost elves. Drow adventurers are r are, and the race does not exist in all worlds. Check with you r Dungeon Master to see if you can play a drow character. Ability Score Increase.

You have proficiency with rapiers, shortswords, and h and crossbow s. Halfl in g Reg is the halfling , the only one of h is k in d for hundreds of miles in any direction, locked his fingers be- hind his head and leaned back against the mossy blanket of the tree trunk. Regis was short, even by the st and ards of his diminutive race, with the fluff ofhis curly brown locks b are ly cresting the three-foot mark, but his belly was amply thickened by his love of a good meal, or several, as the opportunities presented the mselves. The crooked stick that served as his fishing pole rose up above him, clenched between two of his toes, and hung out over the quiet lake, mirrored perfectly in the glassy surface of Maer Dualdon. —R. A. Salvatore, The Crystal Shard lives: a place to settle in peace and quiet, far from marauding monsters and clashing armies; a blazing fire and a generous meal; fine drink and fine conversation. Though some halflings live out the ir day s in remote agricultural communities, o the rsfor m nomadic b and s that travel constantly, lured by the open road and the wide horizon to disc over the w onders of new l and s and peoples. But even the se w and erers love peace, food, hearth, and home, though home might be a wagon jostling along an dirt road or a raft floating downriver.

### Smalland Pr

a c t i c a l The diminutive halflings survive in a world full of larger creatures by avoiding not ice or, barring that, avoiding of fense. St and ing ab out 3 feet t all, the y appear relatively harm less and so have managed to survive for centuries in the shadow of empires and on the edges ofwars and political strife. They are inclined to be st out, weighing between 40 and 45 pounds. Halflings’ skin ranges from tan to pale with a ruddy cast, and the ir hair is usu all y brown or s and y brown and wavy. They have brown or hazel eyes. Halfling men of ten sport long sideburns, but beards are r are among the m and must aches even more so. They like to wear simple, com for table, and practical clo the s, favoring bright colors. Halfling practicality extends beyond the ir clothing. They’re concerned with basic needs and simple pleasures and have little use for ostentation. Even the wealthiest of halflings keep the ir treasures locked in a cellar ra the r than on display for all to see. They have a knack for finding the most straight for ward solution to a problem, and have little patience for di the ring.

### Kindand Curious

Halflings are an affable and cheerful people. They cherish the bonds of family and friendship as well as the com for ts of hearth and home, harboring few dream s of gold or glory. Even adventurers among the m usu all y venture into the world for reasons of

### Affableand Positive

community, friendship, w and erlust, or curiosity. They love disc over ing new things, even simple things, such as an exotic food or an unfamiliar style of clothing. Halflings are easily m oved to pity and hate to see any living thing suffer. They are generous, happily sharing what the y have even in lean time s.

### Blendintothe Crowd

Halflings are adept at fitting into a community of humans, dwarves, or elves, making the mselves valuable and w elcom e. The combination of the ir inherent stealth and the ir unassum ing nature helps halflings to avoid un want ed attention. Halflings w ork readily with o the r s, and the y are loyal to the ir friends, whe the r halfling or o the r wise. They can display remarkable ferocity when the ir friends, families, or com m unities are threatened.

### Pastoral Pleasantries

M ost halflings live in sm all, peaceful communities with large farms and well-kept groves. They r are ly build kingdom sof the ir own or even hold much l and beyond the ir quiet shires. They typic all y don’t recognize any sort of halfling nobility or royalty, instead look ing to family elders to guide the m. Families preserve the ir traditional way s despite the rise and f all of empires. M any halflings live am ong o the r races, where the halflings’ hard work and loyal out look of fer the m abundant rewards and creature com for ts. S om e halfling com m unities travel as a way of life, driving wagons or guiding boats from place to place and maintaining no permanent home. Halflings try to get along with every one else and are loath to make sweeping generalizations— especi all y negative one s. Dwarves. “Dwarves make loyal friends, and you can count on the m to keep the ir word. But would it hurt the m to smile once in a while?” Elves. "They’re so beautiful! Their faces, the ir music, the ir grace and all. It’s like the y stepped out of a wonderful dream. But the re’s no telling what’s going on behind the ir smiling faces— surely more than the y ever let on.” Humans. “ Humans are a lot like us, re all y. At least some of the m are. Step out of the castles and keeps, go talk to the farmers and herders and you’ll find good, solid folk. Not that the re’s any thing wrong with the barons and soldiers—you have to admire the ir conviction. And by protecting the ir own l and s, the y protect us as well.”

### Exploring Opportunities

Halflings usu all y set out on the adventurer’s path to defend the ir communities, support the ir friends, or explore a wide and wonder-filled world. For the m, adventuring is less acare er than an opportunity or som etim es a necessity.

### Halfling Names

A halfling has a give n name, a family name, and possibly a nickname. Family nam es are of ten nicknam es that stuck so tenaciously the y have been passed down through the generations.

You can speak, read, and write Com m on and Halfling. The Halfling language isn’t secret, but halflings are loath to sh are it with o the r s. They write very little, so the y don’t have a rich body ofliterature. Their oral tradition, how ever, is very strong. Alm ost all halflings speak Com m on to converse with the people in w hose l and s the ydwell or through which the y are traveling. Subrace. The two main kinds of halfling, lightfoot and st out, are more like closely related families than true subraces. C hoose one of the se subraces.

### Lightfoot

As a lightfoot halfling, you can easily hide from not ice, even using o the r people as c over. You’re inclined to be affable and get along well with o the r s. In the Forgotten Realms, lightfoot halflings have spread the far the st and thus are the most com m on variety.

### Human

Thesewere the stor ie sof are stlesspeople who long ago took to the seas and rivers in longboats, first to pillage and terrorize, the n to settle. Yet the re was an energy, a love of adventure, that sang from every page. Long into the night Uriel read, lighting c and le after precious c and le. She'd never give n much thought to humans, but the se stories fascinated her. In the se yellowed pages were tales of bold heroes, strange and fierce animals, mighty primitive gods, and a magic that was part and fabric of that distant l and. —Elaine C unningham , Daughter of the Drow In the reckonings ofmost worlds, humans are the you ngest of the com m on races, late to arrive on the world scene and short-lived in com parison to dwarves, elves, and dragons. Perhaps it is beca use of the ir shorter lives that the y strive to achieve as much as the y can in the years the y are give n. Or may be the y feel the y have som ething to prove to the elder races, and that’s why the y build the ir mighty empires on the foundation of conquest and trade. Whatever drives the m, humans are the innovators, the achievers, and the pi one ers of the worlds. ABroadSpectrum With the ir penchant for migration and conquest, humans are more physic all y diverse than o the r com m on races. There is no typical human. An individual can st and from 5 feet to a little over 6 feet t all and weigh from 125 to 250 pounds. Human skin shades range from nearly black to very pale, and hair colors from black to blond (curly, kinky, or straight); males might sport facial hair that is sparse or thick. A lot of humans have a dash of nonhuman blood, revealing hints of elf, orc , or o the r lineages. Humans r each adulthood in the ir late teens and r are ly live even a single century.

### Varietyin All Things

Humans are the m ost adaptable and ambitious people am ong the com m on races. They have widely varying tastes, morals, and customs in the m any different l and s where the y have settled. W hen the y settle, though, the y stay: the y build cities to last for the ages, and great kingdom s that can persist for long centuries. An individual human might have a relatively short life span, but a human nation or culture preserves traditions with origins far beyond the r each of any single human’s memory. They live fully in the present—making the m well suited to the adventuring life—but also plan for the future, striving to leave a lasting legacy. Individu all y and as a group, humans are adaptable opportunists, and the y stay alert to changing political and social dynamics. Ev ery one ’sSecond - BestFriends Just as readily as the y mix with each o the r, humans mingle with members of o the r races. They get along with al most every one, though the y might not be close to m any. Humans serve as ambassadors, diplomats, magistrates, merchants, and functionaries of all kinds. Dwarves. “They’re st out folk, stalwart friends, and true to the ir word. Their greed for gold is the ir downf all, though.” Elves. “It’s best not to w and er into elven woods. They don't like intruders, and you’ll as likely be bewitched as peppered with arrows. Still, if an elf can get past that damned racial pride and actu all y treat you like an equal, you can learn a lot from the m.” Halflings. "It’s hard to beat a meal in a halfling home, as long as you don’t crack you r head on the ceiling— good food and good stories in front of a nice, warm fire. If halflings had a shred of ambition, the y might re all y amount to some thing.”

### Lasting Institutions

W here a single elf or dwarf might take on the responsibility of guarding a special location or a powerful secret, humans found sacred orders and institutions for such purposes. W hile dwarf clans and halfling elders pass on the ancient traditions to each new generation, human temples, g over nments, libraries, and codes of law fix the ir traditions in the bedrock of history. Humans dream of immortality, but (except for those few who see k undeath or divine ascension to escape death’s clutches) the y achieve it by ensuring that the y will be rem em bered when the y are g one. Although some humans can be xenophobic, in general the ir societies are inclusive. Human l and s welcom e large numbers of nonhumans com p are d to the proportion of humans w ho live in nonhuman l and s.

### Exemplarsof Ambition

Humans w ho see k adventure are the most daring and ambitious m em bers of a daring and ambitious race. They see k to earn glory in the eyes of the ir fellows by am assing power, wealth, and fame. More than o the r people, humans champion ca use s ra the r than territories or groups.

### Chondathan

Chonda than s are slender, tawny-skinned folk with brown hair that ranges from al most blond to al most black. M ost are t all and have green or brown eyes, but the se tra its are hardly universal. Humans of Chonda than descent dominate the central l and s of Faerun. around the Inner Sea. p are nts give the ir children names from o the r languages, such as Dwarvish or Elvish (pronounced more or less correctly), but most p are nts give names that are linked to the ir region’s culture or to the naming traditions of the ir ancestors. The material culture and physical characteristics of humans can change wildly from region to region. In the Forgotten Realms, for example, the clothing, architecture, cuisine, music, and literature are different in the northwestern l and s of the Silver M arches than in distant Turmish or Impiltur to the east—and even more distinctive in far-of f Kara-Tur. Human physical characteristics, though, vary according to the ancient migrations of the earliest humans, so that the humans of the Silver M arches have every possible variation of coloration and features. In the Forgotten Realms, nine human ethnic groups are widely recognized, though over a dozen o the rsare found in more localized are as of Faerun. These groups, and the typical nam es ofthe ir mem bers, can be use d as inspiration no matter which world you r human is in.

It’s hard to make generalizations ab out humans, but you r human character has the se tra its. Ability Score Increase. Y our ability scores each increase by 1. Age. Humans r each adulthood in the ir late teens and live less than a century. Alignment. Humans tend toward no particular alignment. The best and the worst are found am ong the m. Size.

### Variant Human Traits

If you r campaign use s the optional feat rules from chapter 5, you r Dungeon Master might all ow the se variant tra its, all of which replace the human’s Ability Score Increase trait.

### Dragonborn

Herfa the rstoodon the f ir stof the threesta ir s that led down from the portal, unmoving. The scales of his face had grown paler around the edges, but Clanless Mehen still look ed as if he could wrestle down a dire bear him- self. His familiar well-worn armor was g one, replaced by violet-tinted scale armor with bright silvery tracings. There was a blazon on his arm as well, the mark of some for eign ho use. The sword at his back was the same, though, the one he had carried since even be for e he had found the twins left in swaddling at the gates of Arush Vayem. fa the r’s face was a skill she'd been for tunate to learn. A human who could n’t spot the shift of her eyes or Havilar’s would certainly see only the indifference of a dragon in Clanless Mehen’s face. But the shift of scales, the arch of a ridge, the set of his eyes, the gape of his teeth—her fa the r's face spoke volumes. But every scale of it, this time, see med completely still— the indifference of a dragon, even to Farideh. —Erin M. Evans, The Adversary Born of dragons, as the ir name proclaim s, the dragonborn walk proudly through a world that greets the m with fearful incom prehension. Shaped by draconic gods or the dragons the mselves, dragonborn origin all y hatched from dragon eggs as a unique race, com bining the best attributes of dragons and humanoids. Som e dragonborn are faithful servants to true dragons, o the r s for m the ranks ofsoldiers in great wars, and still o the r s find the mselves adrift, with no clear c all ing in life.

### Proud Dragon Kin

Dragonborn look very much like dragons st and ing erect in humanoid for m, though the y lack wings or a tail. The first dragonborn had scales of vibrant hues matching the colors of the ir dragon kin, but generations of interbreeding have created a more uni for m appearance. Their sm all, fine scales are usu all y brass or bronze in color, som etim es ranging to scarlet, rust, gold, or copper-green. They are t all and strongly built, of ten st and ing close to 6 1/2 feet t all and weighing 300 pounds or more. Their h and s and feet are strong, talonlike claws with three fingers and a thumb on each h and. The blood of a particular type of dragon runs very strong through some dragonborn clans. These dragonborn of ten boast scales that more closely match those of the ir dragon ancestor—bright red, green, blue, or white, lustrous black, or gleam ing met all ic gold, silver, brass, copper, or bronze. Self - SufficientClans To any dragonborn, the clan is more important than life its elf. Dragonborn owe the ir devotion and respect to the ir clan above all else, even the gods. Each dragonborn’s conduct reflects on the honor of his or her clan, and bringing dishonor to the clan can result in expulsion and exile. Each dragonborn know s his or her station and duties with in the clan, and honor dem and s maintaining the bounds of that position. A continual drive for self-improvement reflects the self-sufficiency of the race as a who le. Dragonborn value skill and excellence in all endeavors. They hate to fail, and the y push the mselves to extreme ef for ts be for e the y give up on some thing. A dragonborn holds mastery of a particular skill as a life time goal. M embers of o the r races w ho sh are the sam e commitment find it easy to earn the respect of a dragonborn. Though all dragonborn strive to be self-sufficient, the y recognize that help is som etim es needed in difficult situations. But the best s our ce for such help is the clan, and when a clan needs help, it turns to an o the r dragonborn clan be for e see king aid from o the r races— or even from the gods.

### Dragonborn Names

Dragonborn have personal nam es give n at birth, but the y put the ir clan names first as a mark of honor. A childhood name or nicknam e is of ten use d am ong clutchmates as a descriptive term or a term of endearment. The name might rec all an even t or center on a habit.

### Uncommon Races

The dragonborn and the rest of the races in this chapter are uncommon. They don’t exist in every world of D&D, and even where the y are found, the y are less widespread than dwarves, elves, halflings, and humans. In the cosmopolitan cities of the D&D multiverse, most people hardly look twice at members of even the most exotic races. But the sm all towns and villages that dot the countryside are different. The common folk are n’t accustomed to see ing members of the se races, and the y react accordingly. Dragonborn. It’s easy to assume that a dragonborn is a monster, especi all y if his or her scales betray a chromatic heritage. Unless the dragonborn starts breathing fire and causing destruction, though, people are likely to respond with caution ra the r than out right fear. Gnome. Gnomes don’t look like a threat and can quickly disarm suspicion with good humor. The common folk are of ten curious ab out gnomes, likely never having see n one be for e, but the y are r are ly hostile or fearful. Half-Elf. Although m any people have never see nahalf-elf, virtu all y every one know s the y exist. A half-elf stranger’s arrival is followed by gossip behind the half-elf's back and stolen glances across the common room, ra the r than any confrontation or open curiosity. Half-Orc. It’s usu all y safe to assume that a half-orc is belligerent and quick to anger, so people watch the mselves around an unfamiliar half-orc. Shopkeepers might surreptitiously hide valuable or fragile goods when a half-orc come s in, and people slowly clear out of a tavern, assuming a fight will break out soon. Tiefling. Half-orcs are greeted with a practical caution, but tieflings are the subject of supernatural fear. The evil of the ir heritage is plainly visible in the ir features, and as far as most people are concerned, a tiefling could very well be a devil straight from the Nine Hells. People might make warding signs as a tiefling approaches, cross the street to avoid passing near, or bar shop doors be for eatiefling can enter.

### Draconians

in the Dragonlance setting, the followers of the evil goddess Takhisis learned a dark ritual that let the m corrupt the eggs of met all ic dragons, producing evil dragonborn c all ed draconians. Five types of draconians, corresponding to the five types of met all ic dragons, fought for Takhisis in the War of the Lance: auraks (gold), baaz (brass), bozak (bronze), kapak (copper), and sivak (silver). In place of the ir draconic breath weapons, the y have unique magical abilities. Draconic Ancestry. You have draconic ancestry. C hoose one type of dragon from the Draconic Ancestry table.

### Gnome

fair hair has a tendency to stick out in every direction, as if expressing the gnom e’s insatiable interest in everything around. A gnom e’s personality is writ large in his or her appearance. A male gnom e’s beard, in contrast to his wild hair, is kept c are fully trimmed but of ten styled into curious for ks or neat points. A gnom e’s clothing, though usu all y made in m odest earth t one s, is elaborately decorated with embroidery, em bossing, or gleam ing jewels.

### Delighted Dedication

As far as gnom es are concerned, being alive is a wonderful thing, and the y squeeze every ounce of enjoyment out of the ir three to five centuries of life. Humans might w onder ab out get ting bored over the c our se of such a long life, and elves take plenty of time to savor the beauties of the world in the ir long years, but gnom es see m to worry that even with all that time, the y can’t get in enough of the things the y want to do and see. Gnom es speak as if the y can’t get the thoughts out of the ir heads fast enough. Even as the y of fer ideas and opinions on a range of subjects, the y still manage to listen c are fully to o the r s, adding the appropriate exclamations of surprise and appreciation along the way. Sk inny and flaxen - haired , h is skin walnut brown and his eyes a startling turquoise, Burgell stood half as t all as Aeron climb up on a stool to look out the peephole. Like most hab- itations in Oeble, that particular tenement had been built for humans, and sm all er residents coped with the resulting awkwardness as best the y could. But at least the relative largeness of the apartment gave Burgell room to pack in all his gnome-sized gear. The front room was his workshop, and it contained a bewildering miscell any of tools: hammers, chisels, saws, lockpicks, tinted lenses, jeweler's loupes, and jars of powdered and shredded ingredients for casting spells. A fat gray cat, the mage’s familiar, lay curled atop a grimoire. It opened its eyes, gave Aeron a disdainful yellow st are, the n appe are d to go back to sleep. —R ichard Lee Byers, The Black Bouquet A constant hum ofbusy activity pervades the warrens and neighborhoods where gnom es for m the ir close- knit communities. Louder sounds punctuate the hum: a crunch of grinding gears here, aminor explosion the re, a yelp of surprise or triumph, and especi all y bursts of laughter. G nom es take delight in life, enjoying every moment of invention, exploration, investigation, creation, and play.

### Vibrant Expression

A gnom e’s energy and enthusiasm for living shines through every inch of his or her tiny body. Gnom es average slightly over 3 feet t all and w eigh 40 to 45 pounds. Their tan or brown faces are usu all y adorned with broad sm iles (beneath the ir prodigious noses), and the ir bright eyes shine with excitement. Their Though gnom es love jokes ofall kinds, particularly puns and pranks, the y’re just as dedicated to the more serious tasks the y under take. M any gnom es are skilled engineers, alchemists, tinkers, and inventors. They’re will ing to make mis take s and laugh at the mselves in the process of perfecting what the y do, taking bold (som etim es foolhardy) risks and dream ing large.

### Bright Burrows

Gnom es make the ir hom es in hilly, w ooded l and s. They live underground but get more fresh air than dwarves do, enjoying the natural, living world on the surface when ever the y can. Their hom es are well hidden by both clever construction and simple illusions. W elcom e visitors are quickly ushered into the bright, warm burrows. Those w ho are not w elcom e are unlikely to find the burrows in the first place. Gnom es w ho settle in human l and s are com m only gemcutters, engineers, sages, or tinkers. Som e human families retain gnom e tutors, ensuring that the ir pupils enjoy a mix of serious learning and delighted enjoyment. A gnom e might tutor several generations of a single human family over the c our se of his or her long life.

### Gnome Names

Gnom es love names, and most have half a dozen or so. A gnom e'smo the r, fa the r, clan elder, aunts, and uncles each give the gnom eaname, and various nicknam es from just ab out every one else might or might not stick over time. Gnom e names are typic all y variants on the names of ancestors or distant relatives, though some are purely new inventions. W hen dealing with humans and o the rsw ho are “stuffy” ab out names, a gnome learns to use no more than three names: a personal name, a clan name, and a nickname, choosing the one in each category that’s the m ost fun to say.

### Deep Gnomes

A third subrace of gnomes, the deep gnomes (or svirfneblin), live in sm all communities scattered in the Underdark. Unlike the duergar and the drow, svirfneblin are as good as the ir surface cousins. However, the ir humor and enthusiasm are dampened by the ir oppressive environment, and the ir inventive expertise is directed most ly toward st one work.

### Seeingthe World

Curious and impulsive, gnom es might take up adventuring as a way to see the world or for the love of exploring. As l over s of gems and o the r fine items, some gnom es take to adventuring as a quick, if dangerous, path to wealth. Regardless ofwhat spurs the m to adventure, gnom es w ho adopt this way of life eke as much enjoyment out ofit as the y do out of any o the r activity the y under take, som etim es to the great annoyance of the ir adventuring com panions.

### Forest Gnome

As a for est gnome, you have a natural knack for illusion and inherent quickness and stealth. In the worlds of D&D, for est gnom es are r are and secretive. They ga the r in hidden com m unities in sylvan for ests, using illusions and trickery to conceal the mselves from threats or to mask the ir escape should the y be detected. Forest gnom es tend to be friendly with o the r good-spirited w oodl and folk, and the y regard elves and good fey as the ir most important all ies.

They range from under 5 feet to ab out 6 feet t all, and from 100 to 180 pounds, with men only slightly t all er and heavier than women.

he saw the figure of a man striding up the path. St and ing, Flint drew back into the shadow of atall pine to see better. The man's walk was marked by an easy grace—an elvish grace, Flint would have said; yet the man’s body had the thickness and tight muscles of a human, while the facial hair was definitely humankind’s. All the dwarf could see of the man’s face beneath a green hood was tan skin and a brownish-red beard. A longbow was slung over one shoulder and a sword hung at his left side.

Half-orcs’ grayish pigmentation, sloping for eheads, jutting jaws, prominent teeth, and towering builds make the ir orcish heritage plain for all to see. Half-orcs st and between 6 and 7 feet t all and usu all y weigh between 180 and 250 pounds. Orcs regard battle scars as tokens of pride and ornamental scars as things of beauty. O the r scars, though, mark an orc or half-orc as a for mer slave or a disgraced exile. Any half-orc who has lived among or near orcs has scars, whe the r the y are marks of humiliation or of pride, recounting the ir past explo its and injuries.

### The Markof Gruumsh

The one-eyed god Gruumsh created the orc s, and even those orcs who turn a way from his worship can’t fully escape his influence. The sam e is true ofhalf-orcs, though the ir human blood moderates the impact of the ir orcish heritage.

He usu all y rose be for e most of his warriors, since he had a strong streak of human blood in him, and he found the day light less bothe r some than most of his tribe did. Among the Bloody Skulls, a warrior was judged by his strength, his fierceness, and his w its. Human ancestry was no blemish against a warrior—provided he was every bit as strong, enduring, and bloodthirsty as his full-blooded kin. Half- orcs who were weaker than the ir orc comrades didn't last long among the Bloody Skulls or any o the r orc tribe for that matter. But it was of ten true that a bit of human blood gave a warrior just the right mix of cunning, ambition, and self-discipline to go far indeed, as Mhurren had. He was master of a tribe that could must er two thous and spears, and the strongest chief in Thar. —R ichard Baker, Swordmage exultation w hen the y join in melee com bat—and ei the r exult along with him or shiver with fear and loathing. Half-orcs are not evil by nature, but evil does lurk with in the m, whe the r the y em brace it or rebel against it. Beyond the rage of Gruumsh, half-orcs feel emotion powerfully. Rage doesn’t just quicken the ir pulse, it make s the ir bodies burn. An insult stings like acid, and sadness saps the ir strength. But the y laugh loudly and heartily, and simple bodily pleasures—feasting, drinking, wrestling, drumming, and wild dancing—fill the ir hearts with joy. They tend to be short-tempered and som etim es sullen, more inclined to action than contemplation and to fighting than arguing. The most accom plished half-orcs are those with enough self- control to get by in a civilized l and.

Those black eyes, cold as a winter storm, were staring right into her heart and the sudden seriousness in his voice jolted her. “What is it the y say?" he asked. “One’sacuriosity, two’s a conspiracy—” “Three'sacurse,” she finished. “You think I have n’t heard that rubbish be for e?” “I know you have.” When she gl are d at him, he added, “It’s not as if I’m plumbing the depths of you r mind, dear girl. That is the burden of every tiefling. Some break under it, some make it the millst one around the ir neck, some revel in it.” He tilted his head again, scrutinizing her, with that wicked glint in his eyes. “You fight it, don’t you?

Their appearance and the ir nature are not the ir fault but the result of an ancient sin, for which the y and the ir children and the ir children’s children will al way s be held accountable.

### Infernal Bloodline

Tieflings are derived from human bloodlines, and in the broadest possible sense, the y still look human. However, the ir infernal heritage has left a clear imprint on the ir appearance. Tieflings have large horns that take any of a variety of shapes: some have curling horns like a ram, o the rshave straight and t all horns like a gazelle’s, and some spiral upward like an antelopes’ horns. They have thick tails, f our to five feet long, which lash or coil around the ir legs when the y get upset or nervous. Their can ine teeth are sharply pointed, and the ir eyes are solid colors—black, red, white, silver, or gold—with no visible sclera or pupil. Their skin t one scover the full range of human coloration, but also include various shades of red. Their hair, cascading down from behind the ir horns, is usu all y dark, from black or brown to dark red, blue, or purple. Self - Reliant and Suspicious Tieflings subsist in sm all minorities found most ly in human cities or towns, of ten in the roughest quarters of those places, where the y grow up to be swindlers, thieves, or crim e lords. Som etim es the y live among o the r minority populations in enclaves where the y are treated with more respect. Lacking a homel and, tieflings know that the y have to make the ir own way in the w orld and that the y have to be strong to survive. They are not quick to trust any one w ho claim s to be a friend, but when a tiefling’s com panions demonstrate that the y trust him or her, the tiefling learns to extend the same trust to the m. And once a tiefling give s some one loyalty, the tiefling is a firm friend or all y for life.

People tend to be suspicious of tieflings, assuming that the ir infernal heritage has left its mark on the ir personality and morality, not just the ir appearance. Shopkeepers keep a close eye on the ir goods when tieflings enter the ir stores, the town watch might follow a tiefling around for a while, and demagogues blame tieflings for strange happenings. The reality, though, is that a tiefling’s bloodline doesn’t affect his or her personality to any great degree. Years of dealing with mistrust does leave its mark on most tieflings, and the y respond to it in different way s. Some choose to live up to the wicked stereotype, but o the rsare virtuous. Most are simply very aw are of how people respond to the m. After dealing with this mistrust through out you th, a tiefling of ten develops the ability to over come prejudice through charm or intimidation.

### Classes

ADVENTURERS ARE EXTRAORDINARY PEOPLE, driven by a thirst for excitement into a life that o the rsw ould never d are lead. They are heroes, com pelled to explore the dark places of the world and take on the ch all enges that lesser w om en and men can’t st and against. Class is the primary definition of what you r character can do. It’s more than a profession; it’s you r character’s c all ing. Class shapes the way you think ab out the world and interact with it and you r relationship with o the r people and powers in the multiverse. A fighter, for example, might view the world in pragmatic terms of strategy and maneuvering, and see herself as just a pawn in a much larger game. A cleric, by contrast, might see him self as a will ing servant in a god’s unfolding plan or a conflict brewing am ong various deities. W hile the fighter has contacts in amercenary com p any or army, the cleric might know a number of priests, paladins, and devotees w ho sh are his faith. Y our class give s you a variety of special features, such as a fighter’s mastery of w eapons and armor, and a wizard’s spells. At low levels, you r class give s you only two or three features, but as you advance in level you gain more and you r existing features of ten improve. Each class entry in this chapter includes a table summ arizing the benef its you gain at every level, and a detailed explanation of each one. Adventurers som etim es advance in more than one class. A rogue might switch direction in life and swear the oath of a paladin. A barbarian might disc over latent magical ability and dabble in the sorcerer class while continuing to advance as a barbarian. Elves are know n to com bine martial mastery with m agical training and advance as fighters and w izards simultaneously. Optional rules for com bining classes in this way, c all ed multiclassing, appear in chapter 6. Twelve classes—listed in the Classes table—are found in al most every D&D world and define the spectrum of typical adventurers.

He laughs as he charges toward the frost giant w ho d are d poach his people’s elk herd. A half-orc snarls at the latest ch all enger to her authority over the ir savage tribe, ready to break his neck with her b are h and s as she did to the last six rivals. Frothing at the m out h, a dwarf slam s his helmet into the face of his drow foe, the n turns to drive his ar more d elbow into the gut ofan o the r. These barbarians, different as the y might be, are defined by the ir rage: unbridled, unquenchable, and un think ing fury. More than a mere emotion, the ir anger is the ferocity of a cornered predator, the unrelenting assault of a storm, the churning turmoil ofthe sea. For some, the ir rage springs from a com m union with fierce animal spir its. O the rs draw from a roiling reservoir of anger at a world full of pain. For every barbarian, rage is a power that fuels not just a battle frenzy but also un can ny reflexes, resilience, and feats of strength.

### Primal Instinct

People of towns and cities take pride in how the ir civilized way s set the m apart from animals, as if denying one’s ow n nature was a mark of superiority. To a barbarian, though, civilization is no virtue, but a sign of weakness. The strong em brace the ir animal nature- keen instincts, primal physicality, and ferocious rage. Barbarians are uncom for table when hedged in by w all s and crowds. They thrive in the wilds ofthe ir homel and s: the tundra, jungle, or grassl and s where the ir tribes live and hunt. Barbarians com e alive in the chaos of combat. They can enter a berserk state where rage take s over, giving the m superhuman strength and resilience. A barbarian can draw on this reservoir of fury only a few time s with out resting, but those few rages are usu all y sufficient to defeat what ever threats arise. ALifeofDanger Not every m em ber of the tribes deem ed “barbarians” by scions of civilized society has the barbarian class. A true barbarian am ong the se people is as uncom m on as a skilled fighter in a town, and he or she plays a similar role as a protector of the people and a leader in time s of war. Life in the wild places of the world is fraught with peril: rival tribes, deadly wea the r, and terrifying monsters. Barbarians charge headlong into that danger so that the ir people don’t have to. Their c our age in the face of danger make s barbarians perfectly suited for adventuring. W and ering is of ten a way of life for the ir native tribes, and the rootless life of the adventurer is little hardship for a barbarian. Som e barbarians m iss the close-knit family structures of the tribe, but even tu all y find the m replaced by the bonds for med among the mem bers of the ir adventuring parties.

### Creatinga Barbarian

W hen creating a barbarian character, think ab out where you r character com es from and his or her place in the world. Talk with you r DM ab out an appropriate origin for you r barbarian. Did you com e from a distant l and, making you a stranger in the are a of the campaign? Or is the campaign set in a rough-and-tumble frontier where barbarians are com m on? What led you to take up the adventuring life? W ere you lured to settled l and s by the prom ise of riches? Did you join for ces with soldiers of those l and s to face a sh are d threat? Did monsters or an invading horde drive you out of you r homel and, making you a rootless refugee? Perhaps you were a pris one r of war, brought in chains to “civilized” l and s and only now able to win you r freedom. Or you might have been cast out from you r people beca use of a crim e you committed, a taboo you violated, or a coup that removed you from a position of authority.

Each time you use this feature after the first, the DC increases by 5. W hen you finish a short or long rest, the DC resets to 10. barbarians attribute the ir rage to different s our ces, how ever. For some, it is an internal reservoir where pain, grief, and anger are for ged into a fury hard as steel. O the rs see it as a spiritual blessing, a gift of a totem animal.

### Pathofthe Berserker

For some barbarians, rage is a means to an end-—that end being violence. The Path of the Berserker is a path of untrammeled fury, slick with blood. As you enter the berserker’s rage, you thrill in the chaos of battle, heedless of you r own health or well-being.

### Retaliation

Starting at 14th level, when you take damage from a creature that is with in 5 feet of you. you can use you r reaction to make a melee weapon attack against that creature.

### Pathofthe Totem Warrior

The Path of the Totem W arrior is a spiritual j our ney, as the barbarian accepts a spirit animal as guide, protector, and inspiration. In battle, you r totem spirit fills you with supernatural might, adding magical fuel to you r barbarian rage. Most barbarian tribes consider a totem animal to be kin to a particular clan. In such cases, it is unusual for an individual to have more than one totem animal spirit, though exceptions exist.

### Spirit Seeker

This benefit works only in short bursts; you f all if you end you r turn in the air and not hing else is holding you aloft. Wolf. W hile you’re raging, you can use a bonus action on you r turn to knock a Large or sm all er creature pr one when you hit it with melee weapon attack. In the worlds of D&D, w ords and music are not just vibrations of air, but vocalizations with power all the ir own. The bard is a master of song, speech, and the m agic the y contain. Bards say that the multiverse w as spoken into existence, that the words ofthe gods gave it shape, and that echoes of the se primordial W ords ofCreation still resound through out the cosm os. The music of bards is an attempt to snatch and harness those echoes, subtly woven into the ir spells and powers. The greatest strength of bards is the ir sheer versatility. M any bards prefer to stick to the sidelines in combat, using the ir magic to inspire the ir all ies and hinder the ir foes from a distance. But bards are capable of defending the mselves in melee if necessary, using the ir m agic to bolster the ir sw ords and armor. Their spells lean toward charm s and illusions ra the r than blatantly destructive spells. They have a wide-ranging know ledge of m any subjects and a natural aptitude that lets the m do al most any thing well. Bards becom e masters of the talents the y set the ir minds to perfecting, from musical per for m ance to esoteric know ledge.

### Learningfrom Experience

True bards are not com m on in the world. Not every minstrel singing in a tavern or jester cavorting in a royal c our t is a bard. Disc over ing the magic hidden in music requires hard study and some measure of natural talent that most troubad our s and jongleurs lack. It can be hard to spot the difference between the se per for m ers and true bards, though. A bard’s life is spent w and ering across the l and ga the ring lore, telling stories, and living on the gratitude of audiences, much like any o the r entertainer. But a depth of know ledge, a level of musical skill, and a touch of magic set bards apart from the ir fellows. Only r are ly do bards settle in one place for long, and the ir natural desire to travel—to find new tales to tell, new skills to learn, and new disc over ies beyond the horizon—make s an adventuring c are er a natural c all ing. Every adventure is an opportunity to learn, practice a variety of skills, enter long-for gotten tombs, disc over lost Ba r d Humming as she traces her fingers over an ancient monument in a long-for gotten ruin, a half-elf in rugged lea the rs finds know ledge springing into her mind, conjured for th by the magic of her song—know ledge of the people who constructed the monument and the mythic saga it depicts. A stern human warrior bangs his sword rhythmic all y against his scale mail, setting the tempo for his war chant and exhorting his com panions to bravery and heroism. The magic of his song for tifies and em boldens the m. Laughing as she tunes her cittern, a gnom e weaves her subtle magic over the assem bled nobles, ensuring that her com panions’ words will be well received. W he the r scholar, skald, or scoundrel, a bard weaves magic through w ords and music to inspire all ies, dem oralize foes, manipulate minds, create illusions, and even heal wounds.

### Musicand Magic

works of magic, decipher old tomes, travel to strange places, or encounter exotic creatures. Bards love to accom p any heroes to witness the ir deeds first h and. A bard who can tell an awe-inspiring story from personal experience earns renown am ong o the r bards. Indeed, after telling so m any stories ab out heroes accom plishing mighty deeds, m any bards take the se the mes to heart and assume heroic roles the mselves.

### Proficiencies

### Creatinga Bard

Bards thrive on stories, whe the r those stories are true or not. Y our character’s back ground and motivations are not as important as the stories that he or she tells ab out the m. Perhaps you had a secure and mundane childhood. There’s no good story to be told ab out that, so you might paint you r self as an orphan raised by a hag in a dismal swamp. Or you r childhood might be worthy of a story. Som e bards acquire the ir magical music through extraordinary means, including the inspiration of fey or o the r supernatural creatures. Did you serve an apprenticeship, studying under a master, following the more experienced bard until you were ready to strike out on you r own? Or did you attend a college where you studied bardic lore and practiced you r musical magic? Perhaps you were a you ng runa way or orphan, befriended by awand ering bard w ho becam e you r mentor.

You regain all expended spell slots when you finish a long rest. For example, if you know the 1st-level spell cure wounds and have a 1st-level and a 2nd-level spell slot available, you can cast cure wounds using ei the r slot.

W hen the appla use dies down, the audience m em bers might find the mselves questioning everything the y held to be true, from the ir faith in the priesthood of the local temple to the ir loyalty to the king.

### Battle Magic

At 14th level, you have mastered the art of weaving spellcasting and weapon use into a single harm onious act. W hen you use you r action to cast a bard spell, you can make one weapon attack as a bonus action. Arm s and eyes upraised toward the sun and a prayer on his lips, an elf begins to glow with an inner light that spills out to heal his battle-worn com panions. Chanting a song of glory, a dwarf swings his axe in wide swaths to cut through the ranks of orcs arrayed against him, sh out ing praise to the gods with every foe’sfall. C all ing down a curse upon the for ces of undeath, a human lifts her holy symbol as light p our s from it to drive back the zom bies crowding in on her com panions. Clerics are intermediaries between the mortal world and the distant planes of the gods. As varied as the gods the y serve, clerics strive to em body the h and iwork of the ir deities. No ordinary priest, a cleric is imbued with divine magic.

### Healersand Warriors

Divine magic, as the name suggests, is the power of the gods, flowing from the m into the world. Clerics are condu its for that power, manifesting it as miraculous effects. The gods don’t grant this power to every one who see ks it, but only to those chosen to fulfill a high c all ing. Harnessing divine magic doesn’t rely on study or training. A cleric might learn for mulaic prayers and ancient rites, but the ability to cast cleric spells relies on devotion and an intuitive sense of a deity’s wishes. Clerics com bine the helpful magic ofhealing and inspiring the ir all ies with spells that harm and hinder foes. They can provoke awe and dread, lay curses of plague or poison, and even c all down flames from heaven to consum e the ir enemies. For those evildoers who will benefit most from amace to the head, clerics depend on the ir com bat training to let the m wade into melee with the power of the gods on the ir side.

### Divine Agents

Not every acolyte or of ficiant at a temple or shrine is a cleric. Som e priests are c all ed to a simple life oftemple service, carrying out the ir gods’ will through prayer and sacrifice, not by m agic and strength ofarms. In some cities, priesthood amounts to a political of fice, viewed as a stepping st one to higher positions ofauthority and involving no com m union with a god at all. True clerics are r are in most hierarchies. W hen a cleric take s up an adventuring life, it is usu all y beca use his or her god dem and s it. Pursuing the goals of the gods of ten involves braving dangers beyond the w all s of civilization, smiting evil or see king holy relics in ancient tombs. M any clerics are also expected to protect the ir deities’ worshipers, which can mean fighting rampaging orc s, negotiating peace between warring nations, or sealing a portal that w ould all ow a demon prince to enter the world. M ost adventuring clerics maintain some connection to established temples and orders of the ir faiths. A temple might ask for a cleric’s aid, or a high priest might be in a position to dem and it.

### Creatinga Cleric

As you create a cleric, the m ost important question to consider is which deity to serve and what principles you want you r character to embody. Appendix B includes lists of m any of the gods of the multiverse. Check with you r DM to learn which deities are in you r campaign. Once you’ve chosen a deity, consider you r cleric's relationship to that god. Did you enter this service will ingly? Or did the god choose you, impelling you into service with no regard for you r wishes? H ow do the temple priests of you r faith regard you: as a champion or a trouble make r? W hat are you r ultimate goals? D oes you r deity have a special task in mind for you? Or are you striving to prove you r self worthy of a great quest?

Cleric Level Spells 1st charm person, disguise self 3rd mirror image, pass with out trace 5th blink, dispel m agic 7th dimension door, polymorph 9th dominate person, modify m em ory Dru id Holding high a gnarled staff wrea the d with holly, an elf sum m ons the fury of the storm and c all s down explosive bolts of lightning to smite the torch-carrying orc s who threaten her for est. Crouching out ofsight on a high tree branch in the for m of a leopard, a human peers out ofthe jungle at the strange construction of a temple of Evil Elemental Air, keeping a close eye on the cultists’ activities. Swinging a blade for m ed of pure fire, a half-elf charges into amass ofskeletal soldiers, sundering the unnatural magic that give s the foul creatures the m ocking sem blance oflife. W he the rcall ing on the elemental for ces of nature or emulating the creatures of the animal world, druids are an embodim ent of nature’s resilience, cunning, and fury. They claim no mastery over nature. Instead, the y see the mselves as extensions ofnature’s indomitable will.

### Powerof Nature

Druids revere nature above all, gaining the ir spells and o the r magical powers ei the r from the for ce of nature its elf or from a nature deity. M any druids pursue a mystic spirituality oftranscendent union with nature ra the r than devotion to a divine entity, while o the r s serve gods ofwild nature, animals, or elemental for ces. The ancient druidic traditions are som etim es c all ed the Old Faith, in contrast to the worship ofgods in temples and shrines. Druid spells are oriented toward nature and anim als— the power of tooth and claw, of sun and m oon, of fire and storm. Druids also gain the ability to take on animal for ms, and some druids make a particular study of this practice, even to the point where the y prefer animal for m to the ir natural for m.

### Preservethe Balance

For druids, nature exists in a precarious balance. The f our elements that make up aworld—air, earth, fire, and water—must remain in equilibrium. If one element were to gain power over the o the r s, the world could be destroyed, drawn into one of the elemental planes and broken apart into its com p one nt elements. Thus, druids oppose cults of Elemental Evil and o the rswho promote one element to the exclusion of o the r s. Druids are also concerned with the delicate ecological balance that sustains plant and animal life, and the need for civilized folk to live in harmony with nature, not in opposition to it. Druids accept that which is cruel in nature, and the y hate that which is unnatural, including aberrations (such as beholders and mind flayers) and undead (such as zom bies and vampires). Druids som etim es lead raids against such creatures, especi all y when the monsters encroach on the druids’ territory. Druids are of ten found guarding sacred sites or watching over regions of unspoiled nature. But when a signifi can t danger arises, threatening nature’s balance or the l and s the y protect, druids take on a more active role in com bating the threat, as adventurers.

### Creatinga Druid

W hen making a druid, consider why you r character has such a close bond with nature. Perhaps you r character lives in a society where the Old Faith still thrives, or was raised by a druid after being ab and one d in the depths of a for est. Perhaps you r character had a dramatic encounter with the spir its of nature, com ing face to face with a giant eagle or dire w olf and surviving the experience. Maybe you r character w as born during an epic storm or a vol can ic eruption, which was interpreted as a sign that becom ing a druid was part of you r character’s destiny. Have you al way s been an adventurer as part of you r druidic c all ing, or did you first spend time as acare take r of a sacred grove or spring? Perhaps you r homel and was befouled by evil, and you took up an adventuring life in hopes of finding a new hom e or purpose.

### Sacred Plantsand Wood

A druid holds certain plants to be sacred, particularly alder, ash, birch, elder, hazel, holly, juniper, mistletoe, oak, rowan, will ow, and yew. Druids of ten use such plants as part of a spellcasting focus, incorporating lengths of oak or yew or sprigs of mistletoe. Similarly, a druid use s such woods to make o the r objects, such as weapons and shields. Yew is associated with death and rebirth, so weapon h and les for scimitars or sickles might be fashi one d from it. Ash is associated with life and oak with strength. These woods make excellent hafts or who le weapons, such as clubs or quarterstaffs, as well as shields. Alder is associated with air, and it might be use d for thrown weapons, such as darts or javelins. Druids from regions that lack the plants described here have chosen o the r plants to take on similar use s. For instance, a druid of a desert region might value the yucca tree and cactus plants. one spell). The spells must be of a level for which you have spell slots. For example, if you are a 3rd-level druid, you have f our 1st-level and two 2nd-level spell slots. With aWisdom of 16, you r list of prep are d spells can include six spells of 1st or 2nd level, in any combination. If you prep are the 1st-level spell cure wounds, you can cast it using a 1st-level or 2nd-level slot. Casting the spell doesn’t remove it from you r list of prep are d spells. You can also change you r list of prep are d spells when you finish a long rest. Preparing a new list of druid spells requires time spent in prayer and meditation: at least 1 minute per spell level for each spell on you r list.

### Beast Shapes

Level Max. CR Limitations Example 2nd 1/4 No flying or swimming speed Wolf 4th 1/2 No flying speed Crocodile 8th 1 — Giant eagle You can stay in a beast shape for a number ofh our s equal to half you r druid level (rounded down). You the n revert to you r normal for m unless you expend an o the r use of this feature. You can revert to you r normal for m earlier by using a bonus action on you r turn.

W hile you are trans for med, the following rules apply: • Y our game statistics are replaced by the statistics of the beast, but you retain you r alignment, personality, and Intelligence, W isdom , and Charisma scores. You also retain all of you r skill and saving throw proficien- cies, in addition to gaining those of the creature. If the creature has the same proficiency as you and the bonus in its stat block is higher than you r s, use the creature’s bonus instead of you r s. If the creature has any legendary or lair actions, you can't use the m. • W hen you trans for m, you assume the beast’s hit points and Hit Dice. W hen you revert to you r normal for m, you return to the number of hit points you had be for e you trans for med. However, if you revert as a result of dropping to 0 hit points, any excess damage carries over to you r normal for m. For example, if you take 10 damage in animal for m and have only 1 hit point left, you revert and take 9 damage. Aslong as the excess damage doesn’t reduce you r normal for m to 0 hit points, you are n’t knocked unconscious. • You can’t cast spells, and you r ability to speak or take any action that requires h and s is limited to the capabilities of you r beast for m. Trans for ming doesn’t break you r concentration on a spell you’ve already cast, how ever, or pr even t you from taking actions that are part of a spell, such as c all lightning, that you’ve already cast. • You retain the benefit of any features from you r class, race, or o the rsour ce and can use the m if the new for m is physic all y capable of doing so. However, you can’t use any ofyour special senses, such as darkvi- sion, unless you r new for m also has that sense. • You choose whe the r you r equipment f all s to the ground in you r space, merges into you r new for m, or is worn by it. W orn equipment functions as normal, but the DM decides whe the r it is practical for the new for m to wear a piece of equipment, based on the crea- ture’s shape and size. Y our equipment doesn’t change size or shape to match the new for m, and any equipment that the new for m can’twear must ei the rfall to the ground or merge with it. Equipment that merges with the for m has no effect until you leave the for m.

Druids recognize each o the r as br o the rsand sisters. Like creatures of the wilderness, how ever, druids som etim es compete with or even prey on each o the r. At a local scale, druids are organized into circles that sh are certain perspectives on nature, balance, and the way ofthe druid.

### Circleofthe Moon

Druids of the Circle of the M oon are fierce guardians of the wilds. Their order ga the rs under the full m oon to sh are new s and trade warnings. They haunt the deepest parts of the wilderness, where the y might go for weeks on end be for e crossing paths with an o the r humanoid creature, let al one an o the r druid. Changeable as the m oon, a druid of this circle might prowl as a great cat one night, soar over the treetops as an eagle the next day, and crash through the undergrowth in bear for m to drive of fatrespassing monster.

### Druidsandthe Gods

Some druids venerate the for ces of nature the mselves, but most druids are devoted to one of the m any nature deities worshiped in the multiverse (the lists of gods in appendix B include m any such deities). The worship of the se deities is of ten considered a more ancient tradition than the faiths of clerics and urbanized peoples. In fact, in the world of Greyhawk, the druidic faith is c all ed the Old Faith, and it claims m any adherents among farmers, for esters, fishers, and o the rswho live closely with nature. This tradition includes the worship of Nature as a primal for ce beyond personification, but also encompasses the worship of Beory, the Oerth Mothe r, as well as devotees of Obad-Hai, Ehlonna, and Ulaa. In the worlds of Greyhawk and the Forgotten Realms, druidic circles are not usu all y connected to the faith of a single nature deity. Any give n circle in the Forgotten Realms, for example, might include druids who revere Silvanus, Mielikki, Eldath, Chauntea, or even the harsh Gods of Fury: Talos, Malar, Auril, and Umberlee. These nature gods are of ten c all ed the First Circle, the first among the druids, and most druids count the m all (even the violent one s) as worthy of veneration. The druids of Eberron hold animistic beliefs completely unconnected to the S over eign Host, the Dark Six, or any of the o the r religions of the world. They believe that every living thing and every natural phenomenon— sun, moon, wind, fire, and the world its elf—has a spirit. Their spells, the n, are a means to communicate with and comm and the se spir its. Different druidic sects, though, hold different philosophies ab out the proper relationship of the se spir its to each o the r and to the for ces of civilization. The Ashbound, for example, believe that ar can e magic is an abomination against nature, the Children of Winter venerate the for ces of death, and the Gatekeepers preserve ancient traditions meant to protect the world from the incursion of aberrations.

### Fighter

A human in clanging plate armor holds her shield be for e her as she runs toward the m assed goblins. An elf behind her, clad in studded lea the r armor, peppers the goblins with arrows loosed from his exquisite bow. The half-orc nearby sh out s orders, helping the two combatants coordinate the ir assault to the best advantage. A dwarf in chain mail interposes his shield between the ogre’s club and his com panion, knocking the deadly blow aside. His companion, a half-elf in scale armor, swings two scim itars in a blinding whirl as she circles the ogre, look ing for a blind spot in its defenses. A gladiator fights for sport in an are na, a master with his trident and net, skilled at toppling foes and moving the m around for the crow d’s delight—and his own tactical advantage. His opp one nt’s sword fl are s with blue light an instant be for e she sends lightning flashing for th to smite him. All of the se heroes are fighters, perhaps the most diverse class of characters in the worlds of Dungeons & Dragons . Questing knights, conquering over lords, royal champions, elite foot soldiers, hardened mercenaries, and b and it kings—as fighters, the y all sh are an unpar all eled mastery with w eapons and armor, and a thorough know ledge of the skills of combat. And the y are well acquainted with death, both meting it out and staring it defiantly in the face. Well - RoundedSpecialists Fighters learn the basics of all com bat styles. Every fighter can swing an axe, fence with a rapier, wield a longsword or a greatsword, use a bow, and even trap foes in a net with some degree of skill. Likewise, a fighter is adept with shields and every for m of armor. Beyond that basic degree of familiarity, each fighter specializes in a certain style of combat. Som e concentrate on archery, some on fighting with two w eapons at once, and some on augmenting the ir martial skills with magic. This combination of broad general ability and extensive specialization make s fighters superior combatants on battlefields and in dungeons alike.

### Trainedfor Danger

Not every m em ber of the city watch, the village militia, or the queen’s army is a fighter. Most of the se troops are relatively untrained soldiers with only the most basic com bat know ledge. Veteran soldiers, military of ficers, trained bodyguards, dedicated knights, and similar figures are fighters. Som e fighters feel drawn to use the ir training as adventurers. The dungeon delving, monster slaying, and o the r dangerous work com m on am ong adventurers is second nature for a fighter, not all that different from the life he or she left behind. There are greater risks, perhaps, but also much greater rewards—few fighters in the city watch have the opportunity to disc over a magic flame tongue sword, for example.

### Creatinga Fighter

As you build you r fighter, think ab out two related elements of you r character's back ground: W here did you get you r combat training, and what set you apart from the mundane warriors around you? W ere you particularly ruthless? Did you get extra help from a mentor, perhaps beca use of you r exceptional dedication? What drove you to this training in the first place? A threat to you r homel and, a thirst for r even ge, or a need to prove you r self might all have been factors. You might have enjoyed for mal training in a noble’s army or in a local militia. Perhaps you trained in a war academy, learning strategy, tactics, and military history. Or you might be self-taught—unpolished but well tested. Did you take up the sword as a way to escape the lim its of life on a farm, or are you following a proud family tradition? W here did you acquire you r w eapons and armor? They might have been military issue or family heirlooms, or perhaps you scrim ped and saved for years to buy the m. Y our armaments are now am ong you r m ost important possessions—the only things that st and between you and death’s embrace.

### Monk

Her fists a blur as the y deflect an incom ing hail of arrows, a half-elf springs over a barricade and throws herself into the m assed ranks ofhobgoblins on the o the r side. She whirls am ong the m, knocking the ir blows aside and sending the m reeling, until at last she st and s al one. Taking a deep breath, a human c over ed in tattoos settles into a battle stance. As the first charging orc s r each him, he exhales and a blast offire roars from his m out h, engulfing his foes. Moving with the silence of the night, a black-clad halfling steps into a shadow beneath an arch and em erges from an o the r inky shadow on a balcony a st one’s throw a way. She slides her blade free ofits cloth- wrapped scabbard and peers through the open window at the tyrant prince, so vulnerable in the grip ofsleep. Whatever the ir discipline, m onks are united in the ir ability to magic all y harness the energy that flows in the ir bodies. W he the r channeled as a striking display of com bat prowess or a subtler focus ofdefensive ability and speed, this energy inf use s all that a monk does.

### The Magicof Ki

M onks make c are ful study of a magical energy that most monastic traditions c all ki. This energy is an element of the magic that suff use s the multiverse—specific all y, the element that flows through living bodies. M onks harness this power with in the mselves to create magical effects and exceed the ir bodies' physical capabilities, and some of the ir special attacks can hinder the flow of ki in the ir opp one nts. Using this energy, m onks channel un can ny speed and strength into the ir unarm ed strikes. As the y gain experience, the ir martial training and the ir mastery of ki give s the m more power over the ir bodies and the bodies of the ir foes.

### Trainingand Asceticism

Sm all w all ed cloisters dot the l and scapes ofthe worlds of D&D, tiny refuges from the flow of ordinary life, where time see msto st and still. The m onks w ho live the re see k personal perfection through contemplation and rigorous training. M any entered the monastery as children, sent to live the re when the ir p are nts died, when food could n’t be found to support the m, or in return for some kindness that the m onks had per for m ed for the ir families. S om emonks live entirely apart from the surrounding population, secluded from any thing that might impede the ir spiritual progress. O the rs are sworn to isolation, em erging only to serve as spies or assassins at the com m and of the ir leader, a noble patron, or some o the r mortal or divine power. The majority of m onks don’t shun the ir neighbors, making frequent vis its to nearby towns or villages and exchanging the ir service for food and o the r goods. As versatile warriors, m onks of ten end up protecting the ir neighbors from m onsters or tyrants. For a monk, becom ing an adventurer means leaving a structured, com m unal lifestyle to becom eaw and erer. This can be a harsh transition, and m onks don’t under take it lightly. Those w ho leave the ir cloisters take the ir w ork seriously, approaching the ir adventures as personal tests of the ir physical and spiritual growth. As a rule, m onks c are little for material wealth and are driven by a desire to accom plish a greater m ission than merely slaying m onsters and plundering the ir treasure. C REATING AMONK As you make you r monk character, think ab out you r connection to the monastery where you learned you r skills and spent you r for mative years. W ere you an orphan or a child left on the monastery’s threshold? Did you r p are nts prom ise you to the m onastery in gratitude for a service per for m ed by the m onks? Did you enter this secluded life to hide from a crim e you com m itted? Or did you choose the monastic life for you r self? Consider why you left. Did the head of you r monastery choose you for a particularly important mission beyond the cloister? Perhaps you were cast out beca use of some violation of the com m unity’s rules. Did you dread leaving, or w ere you happy to go? Is the re som ething you hope to accom plish out side the monastery? Are you eager to return to you r home? Asa result of the structured life of am onastic community and the discipline required to harness ki, m onks are al most al way s lawful in alignment.

### Discipleofthe Elements

W hen you choose this tradition at 3rd level, you learn magical disciplines that harness the power of the f our elements. A discipline requires you to spend ki points each time you use it. You know the Elemental Attunement discipline and one o the r elemental discipline of you r choice, which are detailed in the “Elemental Disciplines” section below. You learn one additional elemental discipline of you r choice at 6th, 11th, and 17th level. W henever you learn a new elemental discipline, you can also replace one elemental discipline that you already know with a different discipline. Casting Elemental Spells.

### Monastic Orders

The worlds of D&D contain a multitude of monasteries and monastic traditions. In l and s with an Asian cultural flavor, such as Shou Lung far to the east of the Forgotten Realms, the se monasteries are associated with philosophical traditions and martial arts practice. The Iron H and School, the Five Stars School, the Nor the rn Fist School, and the Sou the rn Star School of Shou Lung t each different approaches to the physical, mental, and spiritual disciplines of the monk. Some of the se monasteries have spread to the western l and s of Faerun, particularly in places with large Shou immigrant communities, such as Thesk and Westgate. O the r monastic traditions are associated with deities who t each the value of physical excellence and mental discipline. In the Forgotten Realms, the order of the Dark Moon is made up of monks dedicated to Shar (goddess of loss), who maintain secret communities in remote hills, back all ies, and subterranean hidea way s. Monasteries of Ilmater (god of endurance) are named after flowers, and the ir orders carry the names of great heroes of the faith; the Disciples of Saint Sollars the Twice-Martyred reside in the Monastery of the Yellow Rose near Damara. The monasteries of Eberron combine the study of martial arts with a life of scholarship. Most are devoted to the deities of the S over eign Host. In the world of Dragonlance, most monks are devoted to Majere, god of meditation and thought. In Greyhawk, m any monasteries are dedicated to Xan Yae, the goddess of twilight and the superiority of mind over matter, or to Zuoken, god of mental and physical mastery. The evil monks of the Scarlet Br o the r hood in the world of Greyhawk derive the ir fanatic zeal not from devotion to a god but from dedication to the principles of the ir nation and the ir race— the belief that the Suel str and of humanity are meant to rule the world. Pa ladin Clad in plate armor that gleam s in the sunlight despite the dust and grime of long travel, a human lays down her sword and shield and places her h and s on a mort all y wounded man. Divine radiance shines from her h and s, the man’s wounds knit closed, and his eyes open wide with amazement. A dwarf crouches behind an out crop, his black cloak making him nearly invisible in the night, and watches an orc war b and celebrating its recent victory. Silently, he stalks into the ir midst and w hispers an oath, and two ores are dead be for e the y even realize he is the re. Silver hair shining in a shaft oflight that see msto illuminate only him, an elf laughs with exultation. His spear flashes like his eyes as he jabs again and again at a twisted giant, until at last his light over com es its hideous darkness. Whatever the ir origin and the ir mission, paladins are united by the ir oaths to st and against the for ces of evil. W he the r sworn be for eagod’s altar and the witness of a priest, in a sacred glade be for e nature spir its and fey beings, or in a moment of desperation and grief with the dead as the only witness, a paladin’s oath is a powerful bond. It is asour ce of power that turns a dev out warrior into a blessed champion.

### The Causeof Righteousness

A paladin swears to uphold just ice and righteousness, to st and with the good things of the world against the encroaching darkness, and to hunt the for ces of evil wherever the y lurk. Different paladins focus on various aspects of the ca use of righteousness, but all are bound by the oaths that grant the m power to do the ir sacred work. Although m any paladins are devoted to gods of good, a paladin’s power com es as much from a commitment to just ice its elf as it does from a god. Paladins train for years to learn the skills ofcombat, mastering a variety of w eapons and armor. Even so, the ir martial skills are secondary to the magical power the y wield: power to heal the sick and injured, to smite the wicked and the undead, and to protect the innocent and those who join the m in the fight for just ice.

### Beyondthe Mundane Life

Alm ost by definition, the life of a paladin is an adventuring life. Unless a lasting injury has take n him or her a way from adventuring for a time, every paladin lives on the front lines of the cosm ic struggle against The Pa ladin Level Proficiency Bonus Features — Spell Slots per Spell Level— 1st 2nd 3rd 4th 5th 1st +2 Divine Sense, Lay on H and s — — — — — 2nd +2 Fighting Style, Spellcasting, Divine Smite 2 — — — — 3rd +2 Divine Health, Sacred Oath 3 — — — — 4th +2 Ability Score Improvement 3 — — — — 5th +3 Extra Attack 4 2 — — — 6th +3 Aura of Protection 4 2 — — — 7th +3 Sacred Oath feature 4 3 — — — 8th +3 Ability Score Improvement 4 3 — — — 9th +4 — 4 3 2 — — 10th +4 Aura of C our age 4 3 2 — — 11th +4 Improved Divine Smite 4 3 3 — — 12th +4 Ability Score Improvement 4 3 3 — — 13th +5 — 4 3 3 1 — 14th +5 Cleansing Touch 4 3 3 1 — 15th +5 Sacred Oath feature 4 3 3 2 — 16th +5 Ability Score Improvement 4 3 3 2 — 17th +6 — 4 3 3 3 1 18th +6 Aura improvements 4 3 3 3 1 19th +6 Ability Score Improvement 4 3 3 3 2 20th +6 Sacred Oath feature 4 3 3 3 2 evil. Fighters are r are enough am ong the ranks of the militias and arm ies of the world, but even fewer people can claim the true c all ing of a paladin. W hen the y do receive the c all, the se w arriors turn from the ir for mer occupations and take up arms to fight evil. Som etim es the ir oaths lead the m into the service of the crown as leaders of elite groups of knights, but even the n the ir loyalty is first to the ca use of righteousness, not to crow n and country. Adventuring paladins take the ir work seriously. A delve into an ancient ruin or dusty crypt can be a quest driven by a higher purpose than the acquisition of treasure. Evil lurks in dungeons and primeval for ests, and even the sm all est victory against it can tilt the cosm ic balance a way from oblivion.

### Creatinga Paladin

The m ost important aspect of a paladin character is the nature of his or her holy quest. Although the class features related to you r oath don't appear until you r each 3rd level, plan ahead for that choice by reading the oath descriptions at the end of the class. Are you a devoted servant of good, loyal to the gods of just ice and honor, a holy knight in shining armor venturing for th to smite evil? Are you a glorious champion of the light, cherishing everything beautiful that st and s against the shadow, a knight w hose oath descends from traditions older than m any ofthe gods? Or are you an embittered l one r sworn to take vengeance on those who have d one great evil, sent as an angel of death by the gods or driven by you r need for r even ge? Appendix B lists m any deities worshiped by paladins through out the multiverse, such as Torm, Tyr, Heir one ous, Paladine, Kiri-Jolith, Dol Arrah, the Silver Flame, Bahamut, A the na, Re-Horakhty, and Heimd all. How did you experience you r c all to serve as a paladin? Did you hear a whisper from an un see n god or angel while you were at prayer? Did an o the r paladin sense the potential with in you and decide to train you as a squire? Or did some terrible even t—the destruction of you r home, perhaps— drive you to you r quests? Perhaps you stumbled into a sacred grove or a hidden elven enclave and found you r self c all ed to protect all such refuges of goodness and beauty. Or you might have know n from you r earliest m em ories that the paladin’s life was you r c all ing, al most as if you had been sent into the world with that purpose stamped on you r soul. As guardians against the for ces of wickedness, paladins are r are ly of any evil alignment. M ost of the m walk the paths of charity and just ice. Consider how you r alignment colors the way you pursue you r holy quest and the manner in which you conduct you r self be for e gods and mortals. Y our oath and alignment might be in harmony, or you r oath might represent st and ards of behavior that you have not yet attained.

### Ranger

Rough and wild look ing, a human stalks al one through the shadows of trees, hunting the ores he know s are planning a raid on a nearby farm. Clutching a shortsword in each h and, he becom es a whirlwind of steel, cutting down one enemy after an o the r. After tumbling a way from acone of freezing air, an elf finds her feet and draws back her bow to loose an arrow at the white dragon. Shrugging of f the wave of fear that emanates from the dragon like the cold of its breath, she sends one arrow after an o the r to find the gaps between the dragon’s thick scales. Holding his h and high, a half-elf whistles to the hawk that circles high above him, c all ing the bird back to his side. W hispering instructions in Elvish, he points to the owlbear he’s been tracking and sends the hawk to distract the creature while he readies his bow. Far from the bustle of cities and towns, past the hedges that shelter the most distant farms from the terrors of the wild, amid the dense-packed trees of trackless for ests and across wide and empty plains, rangers keep the ir unending watch.

### Deadly Hunters

W arriors of the wilderness, rangers specialize in hunting the m onsters that threaten the edges of civilization—humanoid raiders, rampaging beasts and monstrosities, terrible giants, and deadly dragons.

Rangers focus the ir com bat training on techniques that are particularly use ful against the ir specific favored foes. Thanks to the ir familiarity with the wilds, rangers acquire the ability to cast spells that harness nature’s power, much as a druid does. Their spells, like the ir com bat abilities, emp has ize speed, stealth, and the hunt. A ranger’s talents and abilities are h one d with deadly focus on the grim task of protecting the borderl and s.

### Independent Adventurers

Though a ranger might make a living as a hunter, a guide, or a tracker, a ranger’s true c all ing is to defend the out skirts of civilization from the ravages of monsters and humanoid hordes that press in from the wild. In some places, rangers ga the r in secretive orders or join for ces with druidic circles. M any rangers, though, are independent al most to a fault, know ing that, when a dragon or aband of orc s attacks, a ranger might be the first—and possibly the last—line ofdefense. This fierce independence make s rangers well suited to adventuring, since the y are accustom ed to life far from the com for ts of a dry bed and a hot bath. Faced with city-bred adventurers w ho gro use and whine ab out the hardships of the wild, rangers respond with some

As an inferno rages around her foes, lea the ry wings spread from her back and she take s to the air. Long hair whipped by a conjured wind, a half-elf spreads his arms wide and throws his head back. Lifting him momentarily of f the ground, a wave of magic surges up in him, through him, and out from him in a mighty blast of lightning. Crouching behind a stalagmite, a halfling points a finger at a charging troglodyte. A blast of fire springs from her finger to strike the creature. She ducks back behind the rock for mation with a grin, unaw are that her wild magic has turned her skin bright blue. Sorcerers carry amagical birthright conferred upon the m by an exotic bloodline, some o the r worldly influence, or exposure to un know n cosm ic for ces. One can’t study sorcery as one learns a language, any more than one can learn to live a legendary life. No one chooses sorcery; the power chooses the sorcerer. Magic is a part of every sorcerer, suffusing body, mind, and spirit with a latent power that wa its to be tapped. Som e sorcerers wield magic that springs from an ancient bloodline inf use d with the magic of dragons. O the rs carry a raw, uncontrolled magic with in the m, a chaotic storm that manifests in unexpected way s. The appearance of sorcerous powers is wildly unpredictable. Som e draconic bloodlines produce exactly one sorcerer in every generation, but in o the r lines of descent every individual is a sorcerer. Most of the time, the talents ofsorcery appear as app are nt flukes. Som e sorcerers can’t name the origin of the ir power, while o the rstrace it to strange even ts in the ir own lives. The touch of a demon, the blessing of a dryad at a baby’s birth, or a taste of the water from a mysterious spring might spark the gift of sorcery. Sotoo might the gift of a deity of magic, exposure to the elemental for ces of the Inner Planes or the maddening chaos of Limbo, or a glimpse into the inner workings of reality. Sorcerers have no use for the spellbooks and ancient tom es of m agic lore that wizards rely on, nor do the y rely on a patron to grant the ir spells as w arlocks do. By learning to harness and channel the ir own inborn magic, the y can disc over new and staggering way s to unleash that power.

### Unexplained Powers

Sorcerers are r are in the world, and it’s unusual to find a sorcerer w ho is not involved in the adventuring life in some way. People with magical power see thing in the ir veins soon disc over that the power doesn’t like to stay quiet. A sorcerer’s magic want s to be wielded, and it has a tendency to spill out in unpredictable way s if it isn’tcall ed on.

As a starting character, you'll choose an origin that ties to a draconic bloodline or the influence of wild magic, but the exact s our ce of you r power is up to you to decide. Is it a family curse, passed down to you from distant ancestors? Or did some extraordinary even t leave you blessed with inherent magic but perhaps scarred as well? How do you feel ab out the magical power c our sing through you? Doyou em brace it, try to master it, or revel in its unpredictable nature? Is it a blessing or a curse? Did you see k it out, or did it find you? Did you have the option to ref use it, and do you wish you had? W hat do you intend to do with it? Perhaps you feel like you’ve been give n this power for some lofty purpose. Or you might decide that the power give s you the right to do what you want, to take what you want from those who lack such power. Perhaps you r power links you to a powerful individual in the world—the fey creature that blessed you at birth, the dragon who put a drop of its blood into you r veins, the lich who created you as an experiment, or the deity who chose you to carry this power.

### Draconic Bloodline

Y our innate magic com es from draconic m agic that was mingled with you r blood or that ofyour ancestors. Most of ten, sorcerers with this origin trace the ir descent back to a mighty sorcerer of ancient time swho made a bargain with a dragon or who might even have claimed a dragon p are nt. Som e of the se bloodlines are well established in the world, but most are obscure. Any give n sorcerer could be the first of a new bloodline, as a result of a pact or some o the r exceptional circumstance.

### Dragon Ancestor

At 1st level, you choose one type of dragon as you r ancestor. The damage type associated with each dragon is use d by features you gain later.

### Draconic Ancestry

Dragon Damage Type Black Acid Blue Lightning Brass Fire Bronze Lightning Copper Acid Cold Fire Green Poison Red Fire Silver Cold White Cold You can speak, read, and write Draconic. Addition all y, when ever you make a Charisma check when interacting with dragons, you r proficiency bonus is doubled if it applies to the check.

### Draconic Resilience

As magic flows through you r body, it ca use s physical tra its of you r dragon ancestors to emerge. At 1st level, you r hit point maximum increases by 1 and increases by 1 again when ever you gain a level in this class.

You can’t manifest you r w ings while wearing armor unless the armor is made to accom m odate the m, and clothing not made to accom m odate you r wings might be destroyed when you manifest the m.

### Draconic Presence

Beginning at 18th level, you can channel the dread presence of you r dragon ancestor, causing those around you to becom e awestruck or frightened. As an action, you can spend 5 sorcery points to draw on this power and exude an aura of awe or fear (you r choice) to a distance of 60 feet. For 1 minute or until you lose you r concentration (as if you w ere casting a concentration spell), each hostile creature that starts its turn in this aura must succeed on aWisdom saving throw or be charm ed (if you chose awe) or frightened (if you chose fear) until the aura ends. A creature that succeeds on this saving throw is immune to you r aura for 24 h our s.

### Wild Magic

Y our innate magic com es from the wild for ces of chaos that underlie the order of creation. You might have endured exposure to some for mof raw magic, perhaps through a planar portal leading to Limbo, the Elemental Planes, or the mysterious Far Realm. Perhaps you were blessed by a powerful fey creature or marked by a demon. Or you r magic could be a fluke of you r birth, with no app are nt ca use or reason. However it cam e to be, this chaotic magic churns with in you, waiting for any out let.

### Wild Magic Surge

Starting when you choose this origin at 1st level, you r spellcasting can unleash surges of untamed magic. Immediately after you cast a sorcerer spell of 1st level or higher, the DM can have you roll a d20. If you roll a 1, roll on the W ild Magic Surge table to create arand om magical effect. T id esofChaos Starting at 1st level, you can manipulate the for ces of chance and chaos to gain advantage on one attack roll, ability check, or saving throw.

Any time be for e you regain the use of this feature, the DM can have you roll on the Wild Magic Surge table immediately after you cast a sorcerer spell of 1st level or higher. You the n regain the use of this feature.

### Bend Luck

### Warlock

With a pseudodragon curled on his shoulder, a you ng elf in golden robes sm iles warmly, weaving a magical charm into his h one yed words and bending the palace sentinel to his will. As flames spring to life in her h and s, a wizened human whispers the secret name of her dem onic patron, infusing her spell with fiendish magic. Shifting his gaze between a battered tome and the odd alignment of the stars over head, a wild-eyed tiefling chants the mystic ritual that will open a door way to a distant world. W arlocks are see kers of the know ledge that lies hidden in the fabric of the multiverse. Through pacts made with mysterious beings of supernatural power, warlocks unlock m agical effects both subtle and spectacular. Drawing on the ancient know ledge of beings such as fey nobles, dem ons, devils, hags, and alien entities ofthe Far Realm, warlocks piece toge the r ar can e secrets to bolster the ir own power.

### Swornand Beholden

Awarlock is defined by a pact with an o the r worldly being. Som etim es the relationship between warlock and patron is like that of a cleric and a deity, though the beings that serve as patrons for w arlocks are not gods. A warlock might lead a cult dedicated to a demon prince, an archdevil, or an utterly alien entity—beings not typic all y served by clerics. More of ten, though, the arrangement is similar to that between a master and an apprentice. The warlock learns and grows in power, at the cost ofoccasional services per for m ed on the patron’s behalf. The magic bestowed on awarlock ranges from minor but lasting alterations to the warlock's being (such as the ability to see in darkness or to read any language) to access to powerful spells. Unlike bookish wizards, w arlocks supplement the ir magic with some facility at h and-to-h and combat. They are com for table in light armor and know how to use simple weapons.

### Delversinto Secrets

W arlocks are driven by an insatiable need for know ledge and power, which com pels the m into the ir pacts and shapes the ir lives. This thirst drives warlocks into the ir pacts and shapes the ir later c are ers as well. Stories of warlocks binding the mselves to fiends are widely know n. But m any warlocks serve patrons that are not fiendish.

### Creatinga Warlock

As you make you r warlock character, spend some time think ing ab out you r patron and the obligations that you r pact im poses upon you.

Were you seduced into sum m oning a devil, or did you see k out the ritual that would all ow you to make contact with an alien elder god? Did you search for you r patron, or did you r patron find and choose you? Do you chafe under the obligations of you r pact or serve joyfully in anticipation ofthe rewards prom ised to you? W ork with you r DM to determine how big a part you r pact will play in you r character’s adventuring c are er. Y our patron’s dem and s might drive you into adventures, or the y might consist entirely of sm all favors you can do between adventures. W hat kind of relationship do you have with you r patron? Is it friendly, antagonistic, uneasy, or romantic? H ow important does you r patron consider you to be? What part do you play in you r patron’s plans? Do you know o the r servants of you r patron? How does you r patron com m unicate with you? If you have a familiar, it might occasion all y speak with you r patron’s voice. Som e warlocks find m essages from the ir patrons etched on trees, mingled am ong tea leaves, or adrift in the clouds—m essages that only the warlock can see.

O the rwor ld ly Patro n s The beings that serve as patrons for w arlocks are mighty inhabitants of o the r planes of existence—not gods, but al most godlike in the ir power. Various patrons give the ir w arlocks access to different powers and invocations, and expect signifi can t favors in return. Som e patrons collect w arlocks, doling out mystic know ledge relatively freely or boasting of the ir ability to bind mortals to the ir will.

W iz ard Clad in the silver robes that de not e her station, an elf closes her eyes to shut out the distractions of the battlefield and begins her quiet chant. Fingers weaving in front of her, she com pletes her spell and launches a tiny bead of fire toward the enemy ranks, where it erupts into a conflagration that engulfs the soldiers. Checking and rechecking his work, a human scribes an intricate magic circle in chalk on the b are st one floor, the n sprinkles powdered iron along every line and graceful curve. W hen the circle is complete, he dr one s a long in can tation. A hole opens in space inside the circle, bringing a whiff of brim st one from the o the r worldly plane beyond. Crouching on the floor in a dungeon intersection, a gnom e tosses ahand ful of sm all b one s inscribed with mystic symbols, muttering a few words of power over the m. Closing his eyes to see the visions more clearly, he nods slowly, the n opens his eyes and points down the passage to his left. W izards are supreme magic-use rs, defined and united as a class by the spells the y cast. Drawing on the subtle weave of magic that permeates the cosm os, wizards cast spells of explosive fire, arcing lightning, subtle deception, and brute-for ce mind control. Their magic conjures monsters from o the r planes of existence, glimpses the future, or turns slain foes into zom bies. Their mightiest spells change one substance into an o the r, c all meteors down from the sky, or open portals to o the r worlds.

### Scholarsofthe Arcane

W ild and enigmatic, varied in for m and function, the power of m agic draws students w ho see k to master its mysteries. Som e aspire to becom e like the gods, shaping reality its elf. Though the casting of a typical spell requires merely the utterance of a few strange words, fleeting gestures, and som etim es a pinch or clump ofexotic materials, the se surface com p one nts b are ly hint at the expertise attained after years of apprenticeship and countless h our s of study. W izards live and die by the ir spells. Everything else is secondary. They learn new spells as the y experiment and grow in experience. They can also learn the m from o the r wizards, from ancient tom es or inscriptions, and from ancient creatures (such as the fey) that are steeped in magic.

### The Lureof Knowledge

W izards’ lives are seldom mundane. The closest a w izard is likely to com e to an ordinary life is working as a sage or lecturer in a library or university, t each ing o the rsthe secrets of the multiverse. O the r wizards sell the ir services as diviners, serve in military for ces, or pursue lives of crime or domination. But the lure ofknow ledge and power c all s even the most unadventurous wizards out of the safety of the ir libraries and laboratories and into crumbling ruins and lost cities. M ost w izards believe that the ir counterparts in ancient civilizations k new secrets of magic that have been lost to the ages, and disc over ing those secrets could unlock the path to a power greater than any magic available in the present age.

As a student ofar can e magic, you have a spellbook containing spells that s how the first glimm erings of you r true power. See chapter 10 for the general rules of spellcasting and chapter 11 for the wizard spell list.

### Cantrips

At 1st level, you know three can trips of you r choice from the wizard spell list. You learn additional wizard can trips of you r choice at higher levels, as s how n in the Cantrips Known colum n of the W izard table.

### Your Spellbook

The spells that you add to you r spellbook as you gain levels reflect the ar can e research you conduct on you r own, as well as intellectual breakthroughs you have had ab out the nature of the multiverse. You might find o the r spells during you r adventures. You could disc over a spell recorded on a scroll in an evil wizard's chest, for example, or in a dusty tome in an ancient library. Copying a Spell into the Book. When you find a wizard spell of 1st level or higher, you can add it to you r spellbook if it is of a level for which you have spell slots and if you can sp are the time to decipher and copy it. Copying a spell into you r spellbook involves reproducing the basic for m of the spell, the n deciphering the unique system of not ation use d by the wizard who wrote it. You must practice the spell until you underst and the sounds or gestures required, the n transcribe it into you r spellbook using you r own not ation. For each level of the spell, the process take s 2 h our s and costs 50 gp. The cost represents material comp one nts you expend as you experiment with the spell to master it, as well as the fine inks you need to record it. Once you have spent this time and m one y, you can prep are the spell just like you r o the r spells. Replacing the Book. You can copy a spell from you r own spellbook into an o the r book— for example, if you want to make a back up copy of you r spellbook. This is just like copying a new spell into you r spellbook, but faster and easier, since you underst and you r own not ation and already know how to cast the spell. You need spend only 1 h our and 10 gp for each level of the copied spell. If you lose you r spellbook, you can use the same procedure to transcribe the spells that you have prep are d into a new spellbook. Filling out the remainder of you r spellbook requires you to find new spells to do so, as normal. For this reason, m any wizards keep back up spellbooks in a safe place. The Book’s Appearance. Y our spellbook is a unique compilation of spells, with its own decorative fl our ishes and margin not es. It might be a plain, functional lea the r volume that you received as a gift from you r master, a finely bound gilt-edged tome you found in an ancient library, or even a loose collection of not es scrounged toge the r after you lost you r previous spellbook in a mishap.

To do so. choose a number of wizard spells from you r spellbook equal to you r Intelligence modifier + you r wizard level (minimum of one spell). The spells must be of a level for which you have spell slots. For example, if you're a 3rd-level wizard, you have f our 1st-level and two 2nd-level spell slots. With an Intelligence o f 16, you r list of prep are d spells can include six spells of 1st or 2nd level, in any combination, chosen from you r spellbook. If you prep are the 1st-level spell magic missile, you can cast it using a 1st-level or a 2nd-level slot. Casting the spell doesn’t remove it from you r list of prep are d spells. You can change you r list of prep are d spells when you finish a long rest. Preparing a new list of wizard spells requires time spent studying you r spellbook and m em orizing the in can tations and gestures you must make to cast the spell: at least 1 minute per spell level for each spell on you r list.

### Spellcasting Ability

Intelligence is you r spellcasting ability for you r wizard spells, since you learn you r spells through dedicated study and memorization. You use you r Intelligence when ever a spell refers to you r spellcasting ability. In addition, you use you r Intelligence m odifier when setting the saving throw DC for a wizard spell you cast and when making an attack roll with one. Spell save DC = 8 + you r proficiency bonus + you r Intelligence modifier Spell attack modifier = you r proficiency bonus + you r intelligence modifier

### Ritual Casting

You can cast a wizard spell as a ritual if that spell has the ritual tag and you have the spell in you r spellbook. You don't need to have the spell prep are d.

On you r adventures, you might find o the r spells that you can add to you r spellbook (see the “Y our Spellbook” sidebar).

### Arcane Recovery

You have learned to regain some of you r magical energy by studying you r spellbook. Once per day when you finish a short rest, you can choose expended spell slots to rec over. The spell slots can have a com bined level that is equal to or less than half you r wizard level (rounded up), and n one of the slots can be 6th level or higher.

If you want to cast ei the r spell at a higher level, you must expend a spell slot as normal. By spending 8 h our s in study, you can exchange one or both ofthe spells you chose for different spells of the sam e levels.

### Signature Spells

W hen you r each 20th level, you gain mastery over two powerful spells and can cast the m with little ef for t. Choose two 3rd-level wizard spells in you r spellbook as you r signature spells. You al way s have the se spells prep are d, the y don’t count against the number of spells you have prep are d, and you can cast each of the m once at 3rd level with out expending a spell slot. W hen you do so, you can’t do so again until you finish a short or long rest. If you want to cast ei the r spell at a higher level, you must expend a spell slot as normal. Ar can eTrad it io n s The study of wizardry is ancient, stretching back to the earliest mortal disc over ies of magic. It is firmly established in the worlds of D&D, with various traditions dedicated to its com plex study. The most com m on ar can e traditions in the multiverse revolve around the schools of magic. W izards through the ages have cataloged thous and s of spells, grouping the m into eight categories c all ed schools, as described in chapter 10. In some places, the se traditions are liter all y schools; awizard might study at the School of Illusion while an o the r studies across town at the School of Enchantment. In o the r institutions, the schools are more like academ ic departments, with rival faculties com peting for students and funding. Even w izards who train apprentices in the solitude of the ir own towers use the division of magic into schools as a learning device, since the spells of each school require mastery of different techniques.

### Schoolof Abjuration

The School of Abjuration em p has izes magic that blocks, banishes, or protects. Detractors of this school say that its tradition is ab out denial, negation ra the r than positive assertion.

### Name

CH ARACTERS ARE DEFINED BY MUCH MORE THAN the ir race and class. They’re individuals with the ir own stories, interests, connections, and capabilities beyond those that class and race define. This chapter expounds on the details that distinguish characters from one an o the r, including the basics of name and physical description, the rules of back grounds and languages, and the finer points of personality and alignment. CharacterDeta il s Y our character’s name and physical description might be the first things that the o the r players at the table learn ab out you. It’s worth think ing ab out how the se characteristics reflect the character you have in mind. Y our character’s race description includes sample names for m em bers ofthat race. Put some thought into you r name even if you’re just picking one from a list.

### Sex

You can play a male or female character with out gaining any special benef its or hindrances. Think ab out how you r character does or does not con for m to the broader culture’s expectations of sex, gender, and sexual behavior.

Tika and Artemis : ContrastingCharacters The details in this chapter make a big difference in setting you r character apart from every o the r character. Consider the following two human fighters. Hailing from the Dragonlance setting, Tika Waylan was a brash teenager who had a rough childhood. The daughter of a thief, she ran a way from home and practiced her fa the r’s trade on the streets of Solace. When she tried to rob the proprietor of the Inn of the Last Home, he caught her and took her under his wing, giving her a job as a barmaid. But when the dragonarmies laid was te to the town of Solace and destroyed the inn, necessity for ced Tika into adventure alongside the friends she’d know n from her childhood. Her skill as a fighter (a frying pan remains one of her favorite weapons) combined with her history on the streets gave her skills invaluable in her adventuring c are er. Artemis Entreri grew up on the streets of Calimport in the Forgotten Realms. He use d his w its, strength, and agility to carve out his own territory in one of the city's hundreds of poor shanty towns. After several years, he attracted the not ice of one of the most powerful thieves’ guilds in the city, and he ascended the ranks of the guild quickly despite his you th. Artemis became the favored assassin of one of the city’s pas has, who sent him to far-of f Icewind Dale to rec over some stolen gems. He’saprofessional killer, constantly ch all enging himself to improve his skills. Tika and Artemis are both human and both fighters (with some experience as rogues), possessing similarly high Strength and Dexterity scores, but the re the similarity ends. You don’t need to be confined to binary not ions of sex and gender. The elf god Corellon L are thian is of ten see n as and rogynous or hermaphroditic, for example, and some elves in the multiverse are made in Corellon’s image. You could also play a female character who presents herself as a man, a man w ho feels trapped in a female body, or a bearded female dwarf who hates being mis take n for a male. Likewise, you r character’s sexual orientation is for you to decide.

### Heightand Weight

You can decide you r character’s height and weight, using the in for mation provided in you r race description or on the R and om Height and Weight table. Think ab out what you r character’s ability scores might say ab out his or her height and weight. A weak but agile character might be thin. A strong and tough character might be t all or just heavy. If you want to, you can roll r and omly for you r character’s height and weight using the R and om Height and W eight table. The dice roll give n in the Height Modifier colum n determines the character’s extra height (in inches) beyond the base height. That same num ber multiplied by the dice roll or quantity give n in the Weight Modifier colum n determines the character’s extra weight (in pounds) beyond the base weight.

### Random Heightand Weight

Base Height Base Weight Race Height Modifier Weight Modifier Human 4'8" +2d10 110 lb. x (2d4) lb. Dwarf, hill 3'8” +2d4 115 lb. x (2d6) lb. Dwarf, mountain 4' +2d4 130 lb. x (2d6) lb.

For example, as a human, Tika has a height of 4 feet 8 inches plus 2d10 inches. Her player rolls 2 d 10 and get s a total of 12, so Tika st and s 5 feet 8 inches t all. Then the player use s that sam e roll of 12 and multiplies it by 2d4 pounds. Her 2d4 roll is 3, so Tika weighs an extra 36 pounds ( 1 2 x 3) on top of her base 110 pounds, for a total of 146 pounds.

### Other Physical Characteristics

You choose you r character’s age and the color of his or her hair, eyes, and skin. To add a touch of distinctiveness, you might want to give you r character an unusual or memorable physical characteristic, such as a scar, a limp, or a tattoo. Tika and Artemis : CharacterDetails Consider how the names Tika Waylan and Artemis Entreri set the se characters apart from each o the r and reflect the ir personalities. Tika is a you ng woman determined to prove that she's not just a kid any more, and her name make s her sound you ng and ordinary. Artemis Entreri come s from an exotic l and and carries a more mysterious name. Tika is nineteen years old at the start of her adventuring c are er and has auburn hair, green eyes, fair skin with freckles, and a mole on her right hip. Artemis is a sm all man, compact and all wiry muscle. He has angular features and high cheekb one s, and he al way s see ms in need of ashave. His raven-black hair is thick and full, but his eyes are gray and lifeless— betraying the emptiness of his life and soul.

### Alignment

A typical creature in the worlds of Dungeons & Dragons has an alignment, which broadly describes its moral and personal attitudes. Alignment is a combination of two factors: one identifies morality (good, evil, or neutral), and the o the r describes attitudes toward society and order (lawful, chaotic, or neutral). Thus, nine distinct alignments define the possible combinations. These brief sum m aries of the nine alignments describe the typical behavior of a creature with that alignment. Individuals might vary signifi can tly from that typical behavior, and few people are perfectly and consistently faithful to the precepts of the ir alignment. Lawful good (LG) creatures can be counted on to do the right thing as expected by society. Gold dragons, paladins, and m ost dwarves are lawful good. Neutral good (NG) folk do the best the y can to help o the rsaccording to the ir needs. M any celestials, some cloud giants, and most gnom es are neutral good. Chaotic good (CG) creatures act as the ir conscience directs, with little regard for what o the rsexpect. Copper dragons, m any elves, and unicorns are chaotic good. Lawful neutral (LN) individuals act in accordance with law, tradition, or personal codes. M any m onks and some w izards are lawful neutral. Neutral (N) is the alignment of those w ho prefer to steer clear of moral questions and don’t take sides, DwarvishScript : SampleAlphabet doing what see msbest at the time. Lizardfolk, most druids, and m any humans are neutral. Chaotic neutral (CN) creatures follow the ir whims, holding the ir personal freedom above all else. M any barbarians and rogues, and some bards, are chaotic neutral. Lawful evil (LE) creatures methodic all y take what the y want, with in the lim its of a code of tradition, loyalty, or order. Devils, blue dragons, and hobgoblins are lawful evil. Neutral evil (NE) is the alignment of those who do what ever the y can get a way with, with out com passion or qualms. M any drow, some cloud giants, and yugoloths are neutral evil. Chaotic evil (CE) creatures act with arbitrary violence, spurred by the ir greed, hatred, or bloodlust. Demons, red dragons, and orc s are chaotic evil.

### Alignmentinthe Multiverse

For m any think ing creatures, alignment is a moral choice. Humans, dwarves, elves, and o the r humanoid races can choose whe the r to follow the paths of good or evil, law or chaos. According to myth, the good-aligned gods w ho created the se races gave the m free will to choose the ir moral paths, know ing that good with out free will is slavery. The evil deities w ho created o the r races, though, made those races to serve the m. Those races have strong inborn tendencies that match the nature of the ir gods. Most orcs sh are the violent, savage nature of the orc god, Gruumsh, and are thus inclined toward evil. Even if an orc chooses a good alignment, it struggles against its innate tendencies for its entire life. (Even half-orcs feel the lingering pull of the orc god’s influence.) Alignment is an essential part of the nature of celestials and fiends. A devil does not choose to be lawful evil, and it doesn’t tend toward lawful evil, but ra the r it is lawful evil in its essence. If it some how ceased to be lawful evil, it w ould cease to be a devil. Most creatures that lack the capacity for rational thought do not have alignments—the y are unaligned. Such a creature is incapable of making a moral or ethical choice and acts according to its bestial nature. Sharks are savage predators, for example, but the y are not evil; the y have no alignment.

### Languages

Y our race indicates the languages you r character can speak by default, and you r back ground might give you access to one or more additional languages ofyour choice. Note the se languages on you r character sheet. C hoose you r languages from the St and ard Languages table, or choose one that is com m on in you r campaign. With you r DM ’s perm ission, you can instead choose a language from the Exotic Languages table or a secret language, such as thieves’ can t or the tongue of druids. Som e of the se languages are actu all y families of languages with m any dialects. For example, the Primordial language includes the Auran, Aquan, Ignan, and Terran dialects, one for each of the f our elemental planes. Creatures that speak different dialects ofthe sam e language can com m unicate with one an o the r.

Artemis is lawful evil, unconcerned with the value of sentient life but at least professional in his approach to murder. As an evil character, Artemis is not an ideal adventurer. He began his c are er as a villain, and only cooperates with heroes when he must— and when it’s in his own best interests. In most games, evil adventurers ca use problems in groups alongside o the rswho don’t sh are the ir interests and objectives. Gener all y, evil alignments are for villains and monsters.

### Personal Characteristics

Fleshing out you r character’s personality—the array of tra its, mannerisms, hab its, beliefs, and flaws that give a person a unique identity—will help you bring him or her to life as you play the game. F our categories of characteristics are presented here: personality tra its, ideals, bonds, and flaws. Beyond those categories, think ab out you r character’s favorite w ords or phrases, tics and habitual gestures, vices and pet peeves, and what ever else you can imagine. Each back ground presented later in this chapter includes suggested characteristics that you can use to spark you r imagination. You’re not bound to those options, but the y’re a good starting point.

### Personality Traits

Give you r character two personality tra its. Personality tra its are sm all, simple way s to help you set you r character apart from every o the r character. Your personality tra its should tell you som ething interesting and fun ab out you r character. They should be self- descriptions that are specific ab out what make s you r character st and out. “I’m sm art” is not a good trait, beca use it describes a lot of characters. “I’ve read every book in C and lekeep” tells you som ething specific ab out you r character’s interests and disposition. Personality tra its might describe the things you r character likes, his or her past accomplishments, things you r character dislikes or fears, you r character’s self- attitude or mannerisms, or the influence ofhis or her ability scores. ElvishScript : SampleAlphabet Tika and Artemis : PersonalCharacteristics Tika and Artemis have distinct personality tra its. Tika Waylan dislikes boastfulness and has a fear of heights resulting from a bad f all during her c are er as a thief. Artemis Entreri is al way s prep are d for the worst and moves with a quick, precise confidence. Consider the ir ideals. Tika Waylan is innocent, al most childlike, believing in the value of life and the importance of appreciating every one. Neutral good in alignment, she cleaves to ideals of life and respect. Artemis Entreri never all ows his emotions to master him, and he constantly ch all enges himself to improve his skills. His lawful evil alignment give s him ideals of impartiality and a lust for power. Tika Waylan’s bond is to the Inn of the Last Home. The inn’s proprietor gave her a new chance at life, and her friendship with her adventuring companions was for ged during her time working the re. Its destruction by the marauding dragonarmies give s Tika a very personal reason to hate the m with a fiery passion. Her bond might be phrased as “ I will do what ever it take s to punish the dragonarmies for the destruction of the Inn of the Last Home.” Artemis Entreri’s bond is a strange, al most paradoxical relationship with Drizzt Do’Urden, his equal in swordplay and grim determination. In his first battle with Drizzt, Artemis recognized some thing of himself in his opp one nt, some indication that if his life had g one differently, he might have led a life more like the heroic drow’s. From that moment, Artemis is more than a criminal assassin— he is an antihero, driven by his rivalry with Drizzt. His bond might be phrased as “ I will not rest until I have proved myself better than Drizzt Do’Urden.” Each of the se characters also has an important flaw. Tika Waylan is naive and emotion all y vulnerable, you nger than her companions and annoyed that the y still think of her as the kid the yknew years ago. She might even be tempted to act against her principles if she's convinced that a particular achievement would demonstrate her maturity. Artemis Entreri is completely w all ed of f from any personal relationship and just want s to be left al one. A use ful place to start think ing ab out personality tra its is to look at you r highest and lowest ability scores and define one trait related to each. Ei the r one could be positive or negative: you might work hard to over come a low score, for example, or be cocky ab out you r high score. DraconicScript : SampleAlphabet

### Ideals

Describe one ideal that drives you r character. Y our ideals are the things that you believe in m ost strongly, the fundamental moral and ethical principles that com pel you to act as you do. Ideals encom pass everything from you r life goals to you r core belief system. Ideals might answer any of the se questions: What are the principles that you will never betray? What would prompt you to make sacrifices? What drives you to act and guides you r goals and ambitions? W hat is the single most important thing you strive for? You can choose any ideals you like, but you r character’s alignment is a good place to start defining the m. Each back ground in this chapter includes six suggested ideals. Five of the m are linked to aspects of alignment: law, chaos, good, evil, and neutrality. The last one has more to do with the particular back ground than with moral or ethical perspectives.

### Bonds

Create one bond for you r character. Bonds represent a character’s connections to people, places, and even ts in the world. They tie you to things from you r back ground. They might inspire you to heights of heroism, or lead you to act against you r own best interests if the y are threatened. They can w ork very much like ideals, driving a character’s motivations and goals. Bonds might answer any of the se questions: W hom do you c are m ost ab out? To what place do you feel a special connection? What is you r most treasured possession? Y our bonds might be tied to you r class, you r back ground, you r race, or some o the r aspect of you r character’s history or personality. You might also gain new bonds over the c our se of you r adventures.

### Flaws

Fin all y, choose a flaw for you r character. Your character’s flaw represents some vice, compulsion, fear, or w eakness—in particular, any thing that some one else could exploit to bring you to ruin or ca use you to act against you r best interests. More signifi can t than negative personality tra its, a flaw might answer any of the se questions: What enrages you? W hat’s the one person, concept, or even t that you are terrified of? What are you r vices? In spir atio n Inspiration is a rule the Dungeon Master can use to reward you for playing you r character in a way that’s true to his or her personality tra its, ideal, bond, and flaw. By using inspiration, you can draw on you r personality trait of com passion for the downtrodden to give you an edge in negotiating with the Beggar Prince. Or inspiration can let you c all on you r bond to the defense of you r home village to push past the effect of a spell that has been laid on you.

### Gaining Inspiration

Y our DM can choose to give you inspiration for a variety of reasons. Typic all y, DMs award it when you play out you r personality tra its, give in to the draw back s presented by a flaw or bond, and o the r wise portray you r character in a com pelling way. Y our DM will tell you how you can earn inspiration in the game. You ei the r have inspiration or you don’t—you can’t stockpile multiple “inspirations” for later use.

### Using Inspiration

If you have inspiration, you can expend it when you make an attack roll, saving throw, or ability check. Spending you r inspiration give s you advantage on that roll. Addition all y, if you have inspiration, you can reward an o the r player for good roleplaying, clever think ing, or simply doing som ething exciting in the game. W hen an o the r player character does som ething that re all y contributes to the story in a fun and interesting way, you can give up you r inspiration to give that character inspiration. Ba ckgrounds Every story has a beginning. Y our character’s back ground reveals w here you cam e from, how you becam e an adventurer, and you r place in the world. Y our fighter might have been acour ageous knight or a grizzled soldier. Y our wizard could have been a sage or an artisan. Y our rogue might have gotten by as a guild thief or com m and ed audiences as a jester. Choosing a back ground provides you with important story cues ab out you r character’s identity. The most important question to ask ab out you r back ground is what changed? W hy did you stop doing what ever you r back ground describes and start adventuring? W here did you get the m one y to purc has e you r starting gear, or, if you com e from a wealthy back ground, why don't you have more m one y? H ow did you learn the skills of you r class? W hat sets you apart from ordinary people who sh are you r back ground? Tika and Artemis : Ba ckgrounds Tika Waylan and Artemis Entreri both lived the ir earliest years as street urchins. Tika’s later c are er as a barmaid didn’t re all y change her, so she might choose the urchin back ground, gaining proficiency in the Sleight of H and and Stealth skills, and learning the tools of the thieving trade. Artemis is more defined by his criminal back ground, giving him skills in Deception and Stealth, as well as proficiency with the tools of thievery and poison. The sample back grounds in this chapter provide both concrete benef its (features, proficiencies, and languages) and roleplaying suggestions.

### Proficiencies

Each back ground give sacharacter proficiency in two skills. Skills are described in chapter 7. In addition, most back grounds give a character proficiency with one or more tools. Tools and tool proficiencies are detailed in chapter 5. If a character would gain the same proficiency from two different s our ces, he or she can choose a different proficiency of the same kind (skill or tool) instead.

### Languages

Som e back grounds also all ow characters to learn additional languages beyond those give n by race. See “Languages” earlier in this chapter.

### Equipment

Each back ground provides a package of starting equipment. If you use the optional rule from chapter 5 to spend coin on gear, you do not receive the starting equipment from you r back ground.

### Suggested Characteristics

A back ground contains suggested personal characteristics based on you r back ground. You can pick characteristics, roll dice to determine the mrand omly, or use the suggestions as inspiration for characteristics of you r own creation.

### Customizinga

### Background

You might want to tweak some of the features of a back ground so it better f its you r character or the campaign setting. To custom ize a back ground, you can replace one feature with any o the r one, choose any two skills, and choose a total of two tool proficiencies or languages from the sample back grounds. You can ei the r use the equipment package from you r back ground or spend coin on gear as described in chapter 5. (If you spend coin, you can’t also take the equipment package suggested for you r class.) Fin all y, choose two personality tra its, one ideal, one bond, and one flaw. If you can’t find a feature that matches you r desired back ground, work with you r DM to create one.

### Acolyte

You have spent you r life in the service of a temple to a specific god or pan the on of gods. You act as an intermediary between the realm of the holy and the mortal world, per for m ing sacred rites and of fering sacrifices in order to conduct worshipers into the presence of the divine. You are not necessarily a cleric-per for m in g sacred rites is not the sam e thing as channeling divine power. Choose a god, a pan the on of gods, or some o the r quasi-divine being from am ong those listed in appendix B or those specified by you r DM, and work with you r DM to detail the nature of you r religious service. W ere you a lesser functionary in a temple, raised from childhood to assist the priests in the sacred rites? Or were you a high priest who suddenly experienced acall to serve you r god in a different way? Perhaps you were the leader of a sm all cult out side of any established temple structure, or even an occult group that served a fiendish master that you now deny. Skill Proficiencies: Insight, Religion Languages: Two ofyour choice Equipment: A holy sym bol (a gift to you when you entered the priesthood), a prayer book or prayer wheel, 5 sticks of incense, vestments, a set of com m on clo the s, and a belt pouch containing 15 gp Feature : Shelterof the Fa ithful As an acolyte, you com m and the respect of those who sh are you r faith, and you can per for m the religious cerem onies of you r deity. You and you r adventuring com panions can expect to receive free healing and c are at a temple, shrine, or o the r established presence of you r faith, though you must provide any material com p one nts needed for spells. Those w ho sh are you r religion will support you (but only you) at a m odest lifestyle. You might also have ties to a specific temple dedicated to you r chosen deity or pan the on, and you have a residence the re. This could be the temple where you use d to serve, if you remain on good terms with it, or a temple where you have found a new home. W hile near you r temple, you can c all upon the priests for assistance, provided the assistance you ask for is not hazardous and you remain in good st and ing with you r temple.

### Suggested Characteristics

Acolytes are shaped by the ir experience in temples or o the r religious communities. Their study of the history and tenets of the ir faith and the ir relationships to temples, shrines, or hierarchies affect the ir m annerism s and ideals. Their flaws might be some hidden hypocrisy or heretical idea, or an ideal or bond take n to an extreme. d8 Personality Trait 1 I idolize a particular hero of my faith, and constantly refer to that person’s deeds and example. 3 I see omens in every even t and action.

### Charlatan

You have al way s had a way with people. You know what make s the m tick, you can tease out the ir hearts' desires after a few minutes of conversation, and with a few leading questions you can read the m like the y were children's books. It’sause ful talent, and one that you’re perfectly will ing to use for you r advantage. You know what people want and you deliver, or ra the r, you prom ise to deliver. Com m on sense should steer people a way from things that sound too good to be true, but com m on sense see msto be in short supply when you’re around. The bottle of pink-colored liquid will surely cure that un see mly rash, this ointment—not hing more than a bit offat with a sprinkle of silver dust—can restore you th and vigor, and the re’sabridge in the city that just happens to be for sale. These marvels sound implausible, but you make the m sound like the real deal.

### Suggested Characteristics

Charlatans are colorful characters w ho conceal the ir true selves behind the masks the y construct. They reflect what people want to see, what the y want to believe, and how the y see the world. But the ir true selves are som etim es plagued by an uneasy conscience, an old enemy, or deep-seated trust issues.

### Suggested Characteristics

Criminals might see m like villains on the surface, and m any of the m are villainous to the core. But some have an abundance ofendearing, if not redeeming, characteristics. There might be honor among thieves, but crim inals r are ly s how any respect for law or authority. d8 Personality Trait 4 I would ra the r make a new friend than a new enemy. 8 I blow up at the slightest insult. d6 Ideal 1 Honor.

### Urchin

You fought fiercely over food and kept a constant watch out for o the r desperate souls w ho might steal from you. You slept on rooftops and in all ey way s, exposed to the elements, and endured sickness with out the advantage of m edicine or a place to recuperate.

W hen you are not in combat, you (and companions you lead) can travel between any two locations in the city twice as fast as you r speed would norm all y all ow. Su ggestedCharacteristics Urchins are shaped by lives of desperate p over ty, for good and for ill.

Members of the nobility trade ei the r in legal rights, such as the rights to a mine, a port, or farml and, or in gold bars, measuring gold by the pound ra the r than by the coin. Only merchants, adventurers, and those of fering professional services for hire com m only deal in coins.

### Coinage

Com m on coins com e in several different denominations based on the relative worth of the metal from which the y are made. The three most com m on coins are the gold piece (gp), the silver piece (sp), and the copper piece (cp). With one gold piece, a character can buy a belt pouch, 50 feet of good rope, or a goat. A skilled (but not exceptional) artisan can earn one gold piece a day. The gold piece is the st and ard unit of measure for wealth, even if the coin its elf is not com m only use d. W hen merchants discuss deals that involve goods or services worth hundreds or thous and s of gold pieces, the transactions don’t usu all y involve the exchange of individual coins. Ra the r, the gold piece is a st and ard m easure of value, and the actual exchange is in gold bars, letters of credit, or valuable goods. One gold piece is w orth ten silver pieces, the most prevalent coin among com m one rs. A silver piece buys a laborer’swork for a day, a flask of lamp oil, or a night’s rest in a poor inn. One silver piece is worth ten copper pieces, which are com m on am ong laborers and beggars. A single copper piece buys acand le, a torch, or a piece of chalk. In addition, unusual coins made of o the r precious metals som etim es appear in treasure hoards. The electrum piece (ep) and the platinum piece (pp) originate from f all en empires and lost kingdom s, and the y som etim es aro use suspicion and skepticism when use d in transactions. An electrum piece is worth five silver pieces, and a platinum piece is worth ten gold pieces. A st and ard coin weighs ab out a third of an ounce, so fifty coins weigh a pound.

### Wealth

TH E MARKETPLACE OF A LARGE CITY TEEMS with buyers and sellers of m any sorts: dwarf smiths and elf woodcarvers, halfling farmers and gnome jewelers, not to mention humans of every shape, size, and color drawn from a spectrum of nations and cultures. In the largest cities, al most any thing imaginable is of fered for sale, from exotic spices and luxurious clothing to wicker baskets and practical swords. For an adventurer, the availability of armor, weapons, back packs, rope, and similar goods is of paramount im portance, since proper equipment can mean the difference between life and death in a dungeon or the untamed wilds. This chapter details the mundane and exotic merch and ise that adventurers comm only find use ful in the face of the threats that the worlds of D&D present. St art in gEqu ip ment W hen you create you r character, you receive equipment based on a combination of you r class and back ground. Alternatively, you can start with a num ber of gold pieces based on you r class and spend the m on items from the lists in this chapter. See the Starting Wealth by Class table to determine how much gold you have to spend. You decide how you r character cam e by this starting equipment. It might have been an inheritance, or goods that the character purc has ed during his or her upbringing. You might have been equipped with a weapon, armor, and a back pack as part of military service. You might even have stolen you r gear. Aweapon could be a family heirloom, passed down from generation to generation until you r character fin all y took up the mantle and followed in an ancestor’s adventurous footsteps. Wealth appears in m any for ms in a D&D world. Coins, gemst one s, trade goods, art objects, animals, and property can reflect you r character’s financial well-being. Members of the peasantry trade in goods, bartering for what the y need and paying taxes in grain and cheese.

### Selling Treasure

Opportunities abound to find treasure, equipment, weapons, armor, and more in the dungeons you explore. Norm all y, you can sell you r treasures and trinkets when you return to a town or o the r settlement, provided that you can find buyers and merchants interested in you r loot. Arms, Armor, and O the r Equipment. As a general rule, undamaged weapons, armor, and o the r equipment fetch half the ir cost when sold in a market. W eapons and armor use d by m onsters are r are ly in good enough condition to sell. Magic Items. Selling m agic items is problematic. Finding some one to buy a potion or a scroll isn’t too hard, but o the r items are out of the realm of most but the wealthiest nobles. Likewise, aside from a few com m on magic items, you w on’t norm all y com e across magic items or spells to purc has e. The value of magic is far beyond simple gold and should al way s be treated as such. Gems, Jewelry, and Art Objects. These items retain the ir full value in the marketplace, and you can ei the r trade the m in for coin or use the m as currency for o the r transactions. For exception all y valuable treasures, the DM might require you to find a buyer in a large town or larger community first. Trade Goods. On the borderl and s, m any people conduct transactions through barter. Like gems and art objects, trade goods—bars of iron, bags of salt, livestock, and so on—retain the ir full value in the market and can be use d as currency. Armor and Sh ie lds D&D worlds are a vast tapestry made up of m any different cultures, each with its own technology level. For this reason, adventurers have access to a variety of armor types, ranging from lea the r armor to chain mail to costly plate armor, with several o the r kinds of armor in between. The Arm or table collects the most com m only available types of armor found in the game and separates the m into three categories: light armor, medium armor, and heavy armor. M any warriors supplement the ir armor with a shield. Variant : EquipmentSizes In most campaigns, you can use or wear any equipment that you find on you r adventures, with in the bounds of common sense. For example, a burly half-orc won't fit in a halfling’s lea the r armor, and a gnome would be sw all owed up in a cloud giant’s elegant robe. The DM can impose more realism. For example, a suit of plate armor made for one human might not fit an o the r one with out signifi can t alterations, and a guard’s uni for m might be visibly ill-fitting when an adventurer tries to wear it as a disguise. Using this variant, when adventurers find armor, clothing, and similar items that are made to be worn, the y might need to visit an armorsmith, tailor, lea the rworker, or similar expert to make the item wearable. The cost for such work varies from 10 to 40 percent of the market price of the item. The DM can ei the r roll 1d4 x 10 or determine the increase in cost based on the extent of the alterations required. The Arm or table s how s the cost, weight, and o the r properties of the com m on types of armor worn in the worlds of D&D. Armor Proficiency. Any one can put on a suit ofarmor or strap a shield to an arm. Only those proficient in the arm or’s use know how to w ear it effectively, how ever. Y our class give s you proficiency with certain types of armor. If you w ear armor that you lack proficiency with, you have disadvantage on any ability check, saving throw, or attack roll that involves Strength or Dexterity, and you can’t cast spells. Armor Class (AC). Arm or protects its weare r from attacks. The armor (and shield) you w ear determines you r base Arm or Class. Heavy Armor. Heavier armor interferes with the weare r’s ability to move quickly, stealthily, and freely. If the Arm or table s how s “Str 13” or “Str 15” in the Strength colum n for an armor type, the armor reduces the weare r’s speed by 10 feet unless the weare r has a Strength score equal to or higher than the listed score. Stealth. If the Arm or table s how s “Disadvantage” in the Stealth column, the we are r has disadvantage on Dexterity (Stealth) checks. Shields. A shield is made from w ood or metal and is carried in one h and. W ielding a shield increases you r Arm or Class by 2. You can benefit from only one shield at a time.

### Light Armor

If you w ear light armor, you add you r Dexterity m odifier to the base number from you r armor type to determine you r Arm or Class. Padded.

### Medium Armor

If you wear medium armor, you add you r Dexterity modifier, to a maximum of +2, to the base number from you r armor type to determine you r Arm or Class. Hide. This crude arm or consists ofthick furs and pelts. It is com m only worn by barbarian tribes, evil humanoids, and o the r folk who lack access to the tools and materials needed to create better armor. Chain Shirt. Made of interlocking metal rings, a chain shirt is worn between layers ofclothing or lea the r. This armor of fers m odest protection to the we are r’s upper body and all ows the sound of the rings rubbing against one an o the r to be muffled by out er layers. Scale Mail.

Half plate consists of shaped metal plates that c over m ost of the we are r’s body. It does not include leg protection beyond simple greaves that are attached with lea the r straps.

### Heavy Armor

Of all the armor categories, heavy armor of fers the best protection. These su its ofarmor c over the entire body and are designed to stop a wide range of attacks. Only proficient w arriors can manage the ir weight and bulk. Heavy armor doesn’t let you add you r Dexterity modifier to you r Arm or Class, but it also doesn’t penalize you if you r Dexterity m odifier is negative. Ring Mail. This armor is lea the r armor with heavy rings sewn into it. The rings help rein for ce the armor against blows from swords and axes. Ring mail is inferior to chain mail, and it's usu all y worn only by those w ho can’t af for d better armor. Chain Mail.

### Weapons

### Weapon Proficiency

These weapons include clubs, m aces, and o the rweapons of ten found in the h and s of com m one rs. Martial w eapons, including swords, axes, and polearm s, require more specialized training to use effectively. M ost warriors use martial w eapons beca use the se w eapons put the ir fighting style and training to best use. Proficiency with aweapon all ows you to add you r proficiency bonus to the attack roll for any attack you make with that weapon. If you make an attack roll using aweapon with w hich you lack proficiency, you do not add you r proficiency bonus to the attack roll.

### Weapon Properties

M any weapons have special properties related to the ir use, as s how n in the W eapons table. Ammunition. You can use a weapon that has the ammunition property to make a ranged attack only if you have ammunition to fire from the weapon. Each time you attack with the weapon, you expend one piece of ammunition. Drawing the ammunition from a quiver, case, or o the r container is part of the attack. At the end of the battle, you can rec over half you r expended ammunition by taking a minute to search the battlefield. Y our class grants proficiency in certain weapons, reflecting both the class's focus and the tools you are most likely to use. W he the r you favor a longsword or a longbow, you r w eapon and you r ability to wield it effectively can m ean the difference between life and death while adventuring. The W eapons table s how s the most com m on weapons use d in the worlds of D&D, the ir price and weight, the damage the y deal when the y hit, and any special properties the y possess. Every weapon is classified as ei the r melee or ranged. A melee weapon is use d to attack a tar get with in 5 feet of you, whereas a ranged weapon is use d to attack a tar get at a distance. If you use a weapon that has the ammunition property to make a melee attack, you treat the weapon as an improvised weapon (see "Improvised Weapons" later in the section). A sling must be loaded to deal any damage when use d in this way. Finesse. When making an attack with a finesse weapon, you use you r choice ofyour Strength or Dexterity modifier for the attack and damage rolls. You must use the same m odifier for both rolls. Heavy. Sm all creatures have disadvantage on attack rolls with heavy weapons. A heavy w eapon’s size and bulk make it too large for a Sm all creature to use effectively. Light. A light weapon is sm all and easy to h and le, making it ideal for use when fighting with two weapons. See the rules for two-weapon fighting in chapter 9. Loading. Beca use of the time required to load this weapon, you can fire only one piece of ammunition from it when you use an action, bonus action, or reaction to fire it, regardless of the number of attacks you can norm all y make. Range. A weapon that can be use d to make a ranged attack has a range s how n in p are n the se s after the ammunition or thrown property. The range lists two numbers. The first is the w eapon’s normal range in feet, and the second indicates the w eapon’s maximum range. W hen attacking a tar get beyond normal range, you have disadvantage on the attack roll. You can’t attack a tar get beyond the w eapon’s long range. R each. This w eapon adds 5 feet to you r r each when you attack with it. Special. Aweapon with the special property has unusual rules g over ning its use, explained in the w eapon’s description (see "Special W eapons" later in this section). Thrown. If a weapon has the thrown property, you can throw the w eapon to make a ranged attack. If the weapon is a melee weapon, you use the same ability m odifier for that attack roll and damage roll that you would use for a melee attack with the weapon. For example, if you throw ahand axe, you use you r Strength, but if you throw a dagger, you can use ei the r you r Strength or you r Dexterity, since the dagger has the finesse property. Two-H and ed. This w eapon requires two h and s to use. Versatile. This weapon can be use d with one or two h and s. A damage value in p are n the se s appears with the property—the damage when the weapon is use d with two h and s to make a melee attack.

### Improvised Weapons

Som etim es characters don’t have the ir w eapons and have to attack with what ever is close at h and. An im provised weapon includes any object you can wield in one or two h and s, such as broken glass, a table leg, a frying pan, awagon wheel, or a dead goblin. In m any cases, an im provised weapon is similar to an actual weapon and can be treated as such. For example, a table leg is akin to a club. At the DM ’s option, a character proficient with a weapon can use a similar object as if it w ere that weapon and use his or her proficiency bonus. An object that bears no resem blance to a weapon deals 1d4 damage (the DM assigns a damage type appropriate to the object). If a character use saranged weapon to make amelee attack, or throws a melee weapon that does not have the thrown property, it also deals 1d4 damage. An improvised thrown weapon has a normal range of 20 feet and a long range of 60 feet.

### Silvered Weapons

Som emonsters that have immunity or resistance to nonm agical w eapons are susceptible to silver weapons, so cautious adventurers invest extra coin to plate the ir w eapons with silver. You can silver a single weapon or ten pieces of ammunition for 100 gp. This cost represents not only the price of the silver, but the time and expertise needed to add silver to the weapon with out making it less effective.

### Special Weapons

W eapons with special rules are described here. Lance. You have disadvantage when you use a lance to attack a tar get with in 5 feet of you. Also, a lance requires two h and s to wield when you are n’t mounted. Net. A Large or sm all er creature hit by a net is restrained until it is freed. A net has no effect on creatures that are for mless, or creatures that are Huge or larger. A creature can use its action to make a DC 10 Strength check, freeing its elf or an o the r creature with in its r each on a success. Dealing 5 slashing damage to the net (AC 10) also frees the creature with out harming it, ending the effect and destroying the net. W hen you use an action, bonus action, or reaction to attack with a net, you can make only one attack regardless of the number of attacks you can norm all y make.

Mounts and Veh ic les A good mount can help you move more quickly through the w ilderness, but its primary purpose is to carry the gear that w ould o the r wise slow you down. The Mounts and O the r Anim als table s how s each animal’s speed and base carrying capacity. An animal pulling a carriage, cart, chariot, sled, or wagon can move weight up to five time s its base carrying capacity, including the weight of the vehicle. If multiple animals pull the same vehicle, the y can add the ir carrying capacity toge the r. Mounts o the r than those listed here are available in the worlds of D&D, but the y are r are and not norm all y available for purc has e. These include flying mounts (pegasi, griffons, hippogriffs, and similar animals) and even aquatic mounts (giant sea horses, for example). Acquiring such a mount of ten means securing an egg and raising the creature you r self, making a bargain with a powerful entity, or negotiating with the mount its elf. Barding. Barding is arm or designed to protect an anim al’s head, neck, chest, and body. Any type of arm or s how n on the Arm or table in this chapter can be purc has ed as barding. The cost is f our time s the equivalent armor made for humanoids, and it weighs tw ice as much. Saddles. A military saddle braces the rider, helping you keep you r seat on an active mount in battle. It give s you advantage on any check you make to remain mounted. An exotic saddle is required for riding any aquatic or flying mount. Vehicle Proficiency. If you have proficiency with a certain kind of vehicle (l and or water), you can add you r proficiency bonus to any check you make to control that kind of vehicle in difficult circum stances. Rowed Vessels. Keelboats and rowboats are use d on lakes and rivers. If going downstream, add the speed of the current (typic all y 3 m iles per h our) to the speed of the vehicle. These vehicles can’t be rowed against any signifi can t current, but the y can be pulled upstream by draft animals on the shores. A rowboat weighs 100 pounds, in case adventurers carry it over l and.

### Trade Goods

Most wealth is not in coins. It is m easured in livestock, grain, l and, rights to collect taxes, or rights to res our ces (such as a mine or a for est). Guilds, nobles, and royalty regulate trade. Chartered com panies are granted rights to conduct trade along certain r out es, to send merchant ships to various ports, or to buy or sell specific goods. Guilds set prices for the goods or services that the y control, and determine who may or may not of fer those goods and services. Merchants com m only exchange trade goods with out using currency. The Trade G oods table s how s the value of com m only exchanged goods.

Even in a fantastical world, people require basic necessities such as shelter, sustenance, and clothing. These things cost m one y, although some lifestyles cost more than o the r s.

### Lifestyle Expenses

Lifestyle expenses provide you with a simple way to account for the cost of living in a fantasy world. They c over you r accom m odations, food and drink, and all you r o the r necessities. Fur the r more, expenses c over the cost of maintaining you r equipment so you can be ready when adventure next c all s. At the start of each w eek or month (you r choice), choose a lifestyle from the Expenses table and pay the price to sustain that lifestyle. The prices listed are per day, so if you wish to calculate the cost of you r chosen lifestyle over a thirty-day period, multiply the listed price by 30. Y our lifestyle might change from one period to the next, based on the funds you have at you r disposal, or you might maintain the same lifestyle through out you r character’scare er. Y our lifestyle choice can have consequences. Maintaining a wealthy lifestyle might help you make contacts with the rich and powerful, though you run the risk of attracting thieves. Likewise, living frug all y might help you avoid criminals, but you are unlikely to make powerful connections.

You live in inhumane conditions. With no place to c all home, you shelter wherever you can, sneaking into barns, huddling in old crates, and relying on the good graces of people better of f than you. A wretched lifestyle presents abundant dangers. Violence, disease, and hunger follow you wherever you go. O the r wretched people covet you r armor, weapons, and adventuring gear, which represent a for tune by the ir st and ards. You are beneath the not ice of most people. Squalid. You live in a leaky stable, a mud-floored hut just out side town, or a vermin-infested boarding ho use in the worst part of town. You have shelter from the elements, but you live in a desperate and of ten violent environment, in places rife with disease, hunger, and mis for tune. You are beneath the not ice of m ost people, and you have few legal protections. Most people at this lifestyle level have suffered some terrible set back. They might be disturbed, marked as exiles, or suffer from disease. Poor. A poor lifestyle means going with out the com for ts available in a stable community. Simple food and lodgings, threadb are clothing, and unpredictable conditions result in a sufficient, though probably unpleasant, experience. Y our accom m odations might be a room in a flopho use or in the com m on room above a tavern. You benefit from some legal protections, but you still have to contend with violence, crime, and disease. People at this lifestyle level tend to be unskilled laborers, costerm ongers, peddlers, thieves, mercenaries, and o the r disreputable types. Modest. Amodest lifestyle keeps you out of the slums and ensures that you can maintain you r equipment. You live in an older part of town, renting a room in a boarding ho use, inn, or temple. You don't go hungry or thirsty, and you r living conditions are clean, if simple. Ordinary people living m odest lifestyles include soldiers with families, laborers, students, priests, hedge wizards, and the like. Com for table. Choosing a com for table lifestyle means that you can af for d nicer clothing and can easily maintain you r equipment. You live in a sm all cottage in a middle-class neighborhood or in a private room at a fine inn. You associate with merchants, skilled tradespeople, and military of ficers. Wealthy. Choosing a wealthy lifestyle means living a life of luxury, though you might not have achieved the social status associated with the old m one y of nobility or royalty. You live a lifestyle com parable to that of a highly successful merchant, a favored servant of the royalty, or the owner of a few sm all businesses. You have respectable lodgings, usu all yaspacious hom e in a good part of town or a com for table suite at a fine inn. You likely have a sm all staff of servants. Aristocratic. You live a life of plenty and com for t. You move in circles populated by the m ost powerful people in the community. You have excellent lodgings, perhaps a townho use in the nicest part of town or room s in the finest inn. You dine at the best restaurants, retain the most skilled and fashionable tailor, and have servants attending to you r every need. You receive invitations to the social ga the rings of the rich and powerful, and spend even ings in the comp any of politicians, guild leaders, high priests, and nobility. You must also contend with the highest levels of deceit and tr each ery. The wealthier you are, the greater the chance you will be drawn into political intrigue as a pawn or participant. Food , Drink , and Lodging The Food, Drink, and Lodging table give s prices for individual food items and a single night’s lodging. These prices are included in you r total lifestyle expenses.

Some characters, though, might prefer to spend the ir time a way from civilization, sustaining the mselves in the wild by hunting, for aging, and repairing the ir own gear. Maintaining this kind of lifestyle doesn’t require you to spend any coin, but it is time-consuming. If you spend you r time between adventures practicing a profession, as described in chapter 8, you can eke out the equivalent of a poor lifestyle. Proficiency in the Survival skill lets you live at the equivalent of a com for table lifestyle.

### Services

Adventurers can pay nonplayer characters to assist the m or act on the ir behalf in a variety ofcircum stances. Most such hirelings have fairly ordinary skills, while o the r s are masters of a craft or art, and a few are experts with specialized adventuring skills. S om e of the most basic types of hirelings appear on the Services table. O the r com m on hirelings include any of the wide variety of people who inhabit a typical town or city, when the adventurers pay the m to per for maspecific task. For example, a wizard might pay a carpenter to construct an elaborate chest (and its miniature replica) for use in the Leomund’s secret chest spell. A fighter might com m ission a blacksmith to for ge a special sword. A bard might pay a tailor to make exquisite clothing for an upcom ing per for m ance in front of the duke. O the r hirelings provide more expert or dangerous services. M ercenary soldiers paid to help the adventurers take on a hobgoblin army are hirelings, as are sages hired to research ancient or esoteric lore. If a high-level adventurer establishes a stronghold of some kind, he or she might hire a who le staff of servants and agents to run the place, from a castellan or steward to menial laborers to keep the stables clean. These hirelings of ten enjoy a long-term contract that includes a place to live with in the stronghold as part of the of fered compensation.

### Services

Service Pay Coach cab Between towns 3 cp per mile Within a city 1 cp Hireling Skilled 2 gp per day Untrained 2 sp per day Messenger 2 cp per mile Road or gate toll 1 cp Ship’s passage 1 sp per mile Skilled hirelings include any one hired to per for m a service that involves a proficiency (including weapon, tool, or skill): a mercenary, artisan, scribe, and so on. The pay s how n is a minimum; some expert hirelings require more pay. Untrained hirelings are hired for menial work that requires no particular skill and can include laborers, porters, maids, and similar workers.

### Spellcasting Services

People w ho are able to cast spells don’tfall into the category of ordinary hirelings. It might be possible to find some one w illing to cast a spell in exchange for coin or favors, but it is r are ly easy and no established pay rates exist. As a rule, the higher the level of the desired spell, the harder it is to find some one who can cast it and the more it costs. Hiring some one to cast a relatively com m on spell of 1st or 2nd level, such as cure wounds or identify, is easy enough in a city or town, and might cost 10 to 50 gold pieces (plus the cost of any expensive material comp one nts). Finding some one able and will ing to cast a higher-level spell might involve traveling to a large city, perhaps one with a university or prominent temple. Once found, the spellcaster might ask for a service instead of payment—the kind of service that only adventurers can provide, such as retrieving arare item from a dangerous locale or traversing a monster- infested wilderness to deliver som ething important to a distant settlement. Trin kets W hen you make you r character, you can roll once on the Trinkets table to gain a trinket, a simple item lightly touched by mystery. The DM might also use this table. It can help stock a room in a dungeon or fill a creature’s pockets.

## 6. Customizationoptions

### Multiclassing Example

THE COMBINATION OF ABILITY SCORES, RACE, class, and back ground defines you r character’s capabilities in the game, and the personal details you create set you r character apart from every o the r character. Even with in you r class and race, you have options to fine-tune what you r character can do. But this chapter is for players w ho—with the DM ’s perm ission—want to go a step fur the r. This chapter defines two optional sets of rules for customizing you r character: multiclassing and feats. Multiclassing lets you com bine classes toge the r, and feats are special options you can choose instead of increasing you r ability scores as you gain levels. Y our DM decides whe the r the se options are available in a campaign. Mult ic lass in g Multiclassing all ows you to gain levels in multiple classes. Doing so lets you m ix the abilities of those classes to realize a character concept that might not be reflected in one of the st and ard class options. With this rule, you have the option of gaining a level in a new class when ever you advance in level, instead of gaining a level in you r current class. Y our levels in all you r classes are added toge the r to determine you r character level. For example, if you have three levels in wizard and two in fighter, you’re a 5th-level character. As you advance in levels, you might primarily remain amem ber of you r original class with just a few levels in an o the r class, or you might change c our se entirely, never look ing back at the class you left behind. You might even start progressing in a third or f our th class. Com p are d to a single-class character of the sam e level, you’ll sacrifice some focus in exchange for versatility. Gary is playing a 4th-level fighter. When his character earns enough experience points to r each 5th level, Gary decides that his character will multiclass instead of continuing to progress as a fighter. Gary’s fighter has been spending a lot of time with Dave’s rogue, and has even been doing some jobs on the side for the local thieves’ guild as a bruiser. Gary decides that his character will multiclass into the rogue class, and thus his character be come s a 4th-level fighter and 1st- level rogue (written as fighter 4/rogue 1). When Gary’s character earns enough experience to r each 6th level, he can decide whe the r to add an o the r fighter level (becoming a fighter 5/rogue 1), an o the r rogue level (becoming a fighter 4/rogue 2), or a level in a third class, perhaps dabbling in wizardry than ks to the tome of mysterious lore he acquired (becoming a fighter 4/rogue 1/ wizard 1).

### Prerequisites

To qualify for a new class, you must meet the ability score prerequisites for both you r current class and you r new one, as s how n in the Multiclassing Prerequisites table. For example, a barbarian w ho decides to multiclass into the druid class must have both Strength and W isdom scores of 13 or higher. With out the full training that a beginning character receives, you must be a quick study in you r new class, having a natural aptitude that is reflected by higher-than-average ability scores. M ulticlassing

### Prerequisites

Class Ability Score Minimum Barbarian Strength 13 Bard Charisma 13 Cleric Wisdom 13 Druid Wisdom 13 Fighter Strength 13 or Dexterity 13 Monk Dexterity 13 and Wisdom 13 Paladin Strength 13 and Charisma 13 Ranger Dexterity 13 and Wisdom 13 Rogue Dexterity 13 Sorcerer Charisma 13 Warlock Charisma 13 Wizard Intelligence 13

### Experience Points

The experience point cost to gain a level is al way s based on you r total character level, as s how n in the Character Advancement table in chapter 1, not you r level in a particular class. So, if you are a cleric 6/fighter 1, you must gain enough XPto r each 8th level be for e you can take you r second level as a fighter or you r s even th level as a cleric.

### Hit Pointsand Hit Dice

You gain the hit points from you r new class as described for levels after 1st. You gain the 1st-level hit points for a class only when you are a 1st-level character. You add toge the r the Hit Dice granted by all you r classes to for m you r pool of Hit Dice. If the Hit Dice are the same die type, you can simply pool the m toge the r. For example, both the fighter and the paladin have a d 10, so if you are a paladin 5/fighter 5, you have ten d 10 Hit Dice. If you r classes give you Hit Dice ofdifferent types, keep track of the m separately. If you are a paladin 5/cleric 5, for example, you have five d 10 Hit Dice and five d8 Hit Dice.

### Proficiency Bonus

Y our proficiency bonus is al way s based on you r total character level, as s how n in the Character Advancement table in chapter 1, not you r level in a particular class. For example, if you are a fighter 3/rogue 2, you have the proficiency bonus of a 5th-level character, which is +3.

### Proficiencies

W hen you gain a level in a class o the r than you r first, you gain only some of that class’s starting proficiencies, as s how n in the Multiclassing Proficiencies table.

### Class Features

W hen you gain a new level in a class, you get its features for that level. A few features, how ever, have additional rules when you’re multiclassing: Channel Divinity, Extra Attack, Unar more d Defense, and Spellcasting.

### Channel Divinity

If you already have the Channel Divinity feature and gain a level in a class that also grants the feature, you gain the Channel Divinity effects granted by that class, but get ting the feature again doesn’t give you an additional use of it. You gain additional use s only when you r each a class level that explicitly grants the m to you. For example, if you are a cleric 6/paladin 4, you can use Channel Divinity twice between rests beca use you are high enough level in the cleric class to have more use s. W henever you use the feature, you can choose any of the Channel Divinity effects available to you from you r two classes.

### Extra Attack

If you gain the Extra Attack class feature from more than one class, the features don’t add toge the r. You can’t make more than two attacks with this feature unless it says you do (as the fighter’s version of Extra Attack does). Similarly, the warlock’s eldritch invocation Thirsting Blade doesn’t give you additional attacks if you also have Extra Attack.

### Unarmored Defense

If you already have the Unar more d Defense feature, you can’t gain it again from an o the r class.

### Spellcasting

Y our capacity for spellcasting depends partly on you r com bined levels in all you r spellcasting classes and partly on you r individual levels in those classes. Once you have the Spellcasting feature from more than one class, use the rules below. If you multiclass but have the Spellcasting feature from only one class, you follow the rules as described in that class. Spells Known and Prep are d. You determine what spells you know and can prep are for each class individu all y, as if you were a single-classed mem ber of that class. If you are a ranger 4/wizard 3, for example, you know three 1st-level ranger spells based on you r levels in the ranger class. As 3rd-level wizard, you know three w izard can trips, and you r spellbook contains ten wizard spells, two of which (the two you gained when you r each ed 3rd level as a wizard) can be 2nd-level spells. If you r Intelligence is 16, you can prep are six wizard spells from you r spellbook. Each spell you know and prep are is associated with one of you r classes, and you use the spellcasting ability of that class when you cast the spell. Similarly, a spellcasting focus, such as a holy symbol, can be use d only for the spells from the class associated with that focus. Spell Slots. You determine you r available spell slots by adding toge the r all you r levels in the bard, cleric, druid, sorcerer, and wizard classes, half you r levels (rounded down) in the paladin and ranger classes, and a third ofyour fighter or rogue levels (rounded down) if you have the Eldritch Knight or the Ar can e Trickster feature. Use this total to determine you r spell slots by consulting the Multiclass Spellcaster table. If you have more than one spellcasting class, this table might give you spell slots of a level that is higher than the spells you know or can prep are. You can use those slots, but only to cast you r lower-level spells. If a lower- level spell that you cast, like burning h and s, has an enhanced effect when cast using a higher-level slot, you can use the enhanced effect, even though you don’t have any spells of that higher level. For example, if you are the a for ementi one d ranger 4/ wizard 3, you count as a 5th-level character when determining you r spell slots: you have f our 1st-level slots, three 2nd-level slots, and two 3rd-level slots. However, you don’t know any 3rd-level spells, nor do you know any 2nd-level ranger spells. You can use the spell slots of those levels to cast the spells you do know—and potenti all y enhance the ir effects. Pact Magic. If you have both the Spellcasting class feature and the Pact Magic class feature from the warlock class, you can use the spell slots you gain from the Pact Magic feature to cast spells you know or have prep are d from classes with the Spellcasting class feature, and you can use the spell slots you gain from the Spellcasting class feature to cast w arlock spells you know.

### Ability Scoresand Modifiers

SIX ABILITIES PROVIDE A QUICK DESCRIPTION of every creature’s physical and mental characteristics: • Strength, measuring physical power • Dexterity, measuring agility • Constitution, measuring endurance • Intelligence, measuring reasoning and m em ory • Wisdom, measuring perception and insight • Charisma, measuring for ce of personality Is a character muscle-bound and insightful? Brilliant and charm ing? Nimble and hardy? Ability scores define the se qualities—a creature’s assets as well as weaknesses. The three main rolls of the gam e—the ability check, the saving throw, and the attack roll—rely on the six ability scores. The book’s introduction describes the basic rule behind the se rolls: roll a d20, add an ability modifier derived from one of the six ability scores, and com p are the total to a tar get number. This chapter foc use s on how to use ability checks and saving throws, c over ing the fundamental activities that creatures attempt in the game. Rules for attack rolls appear in chapter 9. Abil ity Sc ores and Mod ifie r s Each of a creature’s abilities has a score, a number that defines the magnitude of that ability. An ability score is not just a measure of innate capabilities, but also encom passes a creature’s training and com petence in activities related to that ability. A score of 10 or 11 is the normal human average, but adventurers and m any monsters are a cut above average in most abilities. A score of 18 is the highest that a person usu all yreach es. Adventurers can have scores as high as 20, and monsters and divine beings can have scores as high as 30. Each ability also has a modifier, derived from the score and ranging from 5 (for an ability score of 1) to +10 (for a score of 30). The Ability Scores and M odifiers table not es the ability m odifiers for the range of possible ability scores, from 1 to 30. Score Modifier Score Modifier 1 -5 16-17 +3 2-3 -4 18-19 +4 4-5 -3 20-21 +5 6-7 -2 22-23 +6 8-9 -1 24-25 +7 10-11 +0 26-27 +8 12-13 +1 28-29 +9 14-15 +2 30 +10 To determine an ability m odifier with out consulting the table, subtract 10 from the ability score and the n divide the total by 2 (round down). Beca use ability modifiers affect al most every attack roll, ability check, and saving throw, ability modifiers com e up in play more of ten than the ir associated scores.

### Advantageand

D is advantage Som etim es a special ability or spell tells you that you have advantage or disadvantage on an ability check, a saving throw, or an attack roll. W hen that happens, you roll a second d20 when you make the roll. Use the higher of the two rolls if you have advantage, and use the lower roll if you have disadvantage. For example, if you have disadvantage and roll a 17 and a 5, you use the 5. If you instead have advantage and roll those numbers, you use the 17. If multiple situations affect a roll and each one grants advantage or im poses disadvantage on it, you don’t roll more than one additional d20. If two favorable situations grant advantage, for example, you still roll only one additional d20. If circum stances ca use a roll to have both advantage and disadvantage, you are considered to have nei the r of the m, and you roll one d20. This is true even if multiple circum stances im pose disadvantage and only one grants advantage or vice versa. In such a situation, you have nei the r advantage nor disadvantage. W hen you have advantage or disadvantage and som ething in the game, such as the halfling’s Lucky trait, lets you reroll the d20, you can reroll only one of the dice. You choose which one. For example, if a halfling has advantage on an ability check and rolls a 1 and a 13, the halfling could use the Lucky trait to reroll the 1. You usu all y gain advantage or disadvantage through the use of special abilities, actions, or spells. Inspiration (see chapter 4) can also give a character advantage on checks related to the character’s personality, ideals, or bonds. The DM can also decide that circum stances influence a roll in one direction or the o the r and grant advantage or im pose disadvantage as a result. Prof ic ie ncyBonus Characters have a proficiency bonus determined by level, as detailed in chapter 1. Monsters also have this bonus, which is incorporated in the ir stat blocks. The bonus is use d in the rules on ability checks, saving throws, and attack rolls. Y our proficiency bonus can’t be added to a single die roll or o the r number more than once. For example, if two different rules say you can add you r proficiency bonus to aWisdom saving throw, you never the less add the bonus only once when you make the save. Occasion all y, you r proficiency bonus might be multiplied or divided (doubled or halved, for example) be for e you apply it. For example, the rogue's Expertise feature doubles the proficiency bonus for certain ability checks. If a circum stance suggests that you r proficiency bonus applies more than once to the sam e roll, you still add it only once and multiply or divide it only once. By the sam e token, if a feature or effect all ows you to multiply you r proficiency bonus when making an ability check that w ouldn’t norm all y benefit from you r proficiency bonus, you still don’t add the bonus to the check. For that check you r proficiency bonus is 0, give n the fact that multiplying 0 by any number is still 0. For instance, if you lack proficiency in the History skill, you gain no benefit from a feature that lets you double you r proficiency bonus when you make Intelligence (History) checks. In general, you don’t multiply you r proficiency bonus for attack rolls or saving throws. If a feature or effect all ows you to do so, the se same rules apply.

### Ability Checks

An ability check tests a character’s or monster’s innate talent and training in an ef for t to over com each all enge. The DM c all s for an ability check when a character or monster attempts an action (o the r than an attack) that has a chance of failure. W hen the out com e is uncertain, the dice determine the results. For every ability check, the DM decides which of the six abilities is relevant to the task at h and and the difficulty of the task, represented by a Difficulty Class. The more difficult a task, the higher its DC. The Typical Difficulty Classes table s how s the most com m on DCs.

### Typical Difficulty Classes

Task Difficulty DC Very easy 5 Easy 10 Medium 15 Hard 20 Very hard 25 Nearly impossible 30 To make an ability check, roll a d20 and add the relevant ability modifier. As with o the r d20 rolls, apply bon use s and penalties, and com p are the total to the DC. If the total equals or exceeds the DC, the ability check is a success—the creature over com es the ch all enge at h and. O the rwise, it’safailure, which means the character or monster make s no progress toward the objective or make s progress com bined with a set back determined by the DM. Contests _______________________________ Som etim es one character’s or monster’s ef for ts are directly opposed to an o the r’s. This can occur when both of the m are trying to do the sam e thing and only one can succeed, such as attempting to snatch up a magic ring that has f all en on the floor. This situation also applies when one of the m is trying to pr even t the o the r one from accom plishing a goal—for example, when a monster tries to for ce open a door that an adventurer is holding closed. In situations like the se, the out come is determined by a special for m of ability check, c all ed a contest. Both participants in a contest make ability checks appropriate to the ir ef for ts. They apply all appropriate bon use s and penalties, but instead ofcom paring the total to a DC, the y com p are the totals of the ir two checks. The participant with the higher check total wins the contest. That character or monster ei the r succeeds at the action or pr even ts the o the r one from succeeding. If the contest results in a tie, the situation remains the same as it was be for e the contest. Thus, one contestant might win the contest by default. If two characters tie in a contest to snatch a ring of f the floor, nei the r character grabs it. In a contest between a monster trying to open a door and an adventurer trying to keep the door closed, a tie means that the door remains shut. Sk ills Each ability c over sabroad range of capabilities, including skills that a character or a monster can be proficient in. A skill represents a specific aspect of an ability score, and an individual’s proficiency in a skill demonstrates a focus on that aspect. (A character’s starting skill proficiencies are determined at character creation, and a monster’s skill proficiencies appear in the monster’s stat block.) For example, a Dexterity check might reflect a character’s attempt to pull of f an acrobatic stunt, to palm an object, or to stay hidden. Each of the se aspects of Dexterity has an associated skill: Acrobatics, Sleight of H and, and Stealth, respectively. Soa character w ho has proficiency in the Stealth skill is particularly good at Dexterity checks related to sneaking and hiding. The skills related to each ability score are s how n in the following list. (No skills are related to Constitution.) S ee an ability’s description in the later sections ofthis chapter for examples of how to use a skill associated with an ability. Som etim es, the DM might ask for an ability check using a specific skill—for example, “Make aWisdom (Perception) check.” At o the r time s, a player might ask the DM if proficiency in a particular skill applies to a check. In ei the r case, proficiency in a skill means an individual can add his or her proficiency bonus to ability checks that involve that skill. With out proficiency in the skill, the individual make sanormal ability check. Strength Athletics Dexterity Acrobatics Sleight of H and Stealth Intelligence Ar can a History Investigation Nature Religion Wisdom Anim al H and ling Insight Medicine Perception Survival Charisma Deception Intimidation Per for m ance Persuasion For example, if a character attempts to clim b up a dangerous cliff, the Dungeon Master might ask for a Strength (Athletics) check. If the character is proficient in Athletics, the character’s proficiency bonus is added to the Strength check. If the character lacks that proficiency, he or she just make saStrength check. Variant : Skills with DifferentAbilities Norm all y, you r proficiency in a skill applies only to a specific kind of ability check. Proficiency in Athletics, for example, usu all y applies to Strength checks. In some situations, though, you r proficiency might reasonably apply to a different kind of check. In such cases, the DM might ask for a check using an unusual combination of ability and skill, or you might ask you r DM if you can apply a proficiency to a different check. For example, if you have to swim from an of fshore isl and to the mainl and, you r DM might c all for a Constitution check to see if you have the stamina to make it that far. In this case, you r DM might all ow you to apply you r proficiency in Athletics and ask for a Constitution (Athletics) check. Soif you’re proficient in Athletics, you apply you r proficiency bonus to the Constitution check just as you would norm all y do for a Strength (Athletics) check. Similarly, when you r half-orc barbarian use sadisplay of raw strength to intimidate an enemy, you r DM might ask for a Strength (Intimidation) check, even though Intimidation is norm all y associated with Charisma. Pa ssiv eChecks A passive check is a special kind of ability check that doesn’t involve any die rolls. Such a check can represent the average result for a task d one repeatedly, such as searching for secret doors over and over again, or can be use d when the DM want s to secretly determine whe the r the characters succeed at som ething with out rolling dice, such as not icing a hidden monster. Here’s how to determine a character’s total for a passive check: 10 + all modifiers that norm all y apply to the check If the character has advantage on the check, add 5. For disadvantage, subtract 5. The game refers to a passive check total as a score. For example, if a 1st-level character has aWisdom of 15 and proficiency in Perception, he or she has a passive W isdom (Perception) score of 14. The rules on hiding in the “Dexterity” section below rely on passive checks, as do the exploration rules in chapter 8.

### Working Together

Som etim es two or more characters team up to attempt a task. The character w ho’s leading the ef for t—or the one with the highest ability m odifier—can make an ability check with advantage, reflecting the help provided by the o the r characters. In combat, this requires the Help action (see chapter 9). A character can only provide help if the task is one that he or she could attempt al one. For example, trying to open a lock requires proficiency with thieves’ tools, so a character who lacks that proficiency can’t help an o the r character in that task. More over, a character can help only when two or more individuals working toge the r would actu all y be productive. Som e tasks, such as threading a needle, are no easier with help.

### Group Checks

W hen a number of individuals are trying to accom plish som ething as a group, the DM might ask for a group ability check. In such a situation, the characters w ho are skilled at a particular task help c over those w ho are n't. To make a group ability check, every one in the group m akes the ability check. If at least half the group succeeds, the who le group succeeds. O the rwise, the group fails. Group checks don’t com e up very of ten, and the y’re most use ful when all the characters succeed or fail as a group. For example, when adventurers are navigating a swamp, the DM might c all for a group W isdom (Survival) check to see if the characters can avoid the quicks and, sinkholes, and o the r natural hazards ofthe environment. If at least half the group succeeds, the successful characters are able to guide the ir com panions out of danger. O the rwise, the group stumbles into one ofthese hazards. Usin g Ea chAb il ity Every task that a character or monster might attempt in the game is c over ed by one of the six abilities. This section explains in more detail what those abilities mean and the way s the y are use d in the game. St rength Strength m easures bodily power, athletic training, and the extent to which you can exert raw physical for ce. St rengthChecks A Strength check can m odel any attempt to lift, push, pull, or break some thing, to for ce you r body through a space, or to o the r wise apply brute for ce to a situation. The Athletics skill reflects aptitude in certain kinds of Strength checks. Athletics. Y our Strength (Athletics) check c over s difficult situations you encounter while climbing, jumping, or swimming. Examples include the following activities: • You attempt to climb a sheer or slippery cliff, avoid hazards while scaling awall, or cling to a surface while som ething is trying to knock you of f. • You try to jum p an unusu all y long distance or pull of fastunt midjump. • You struggle to swim or stay afloat in tr each erous cur­ rents, storm -tossed waves, or are as ofthick seaweed. Or an o the r creature tries to push or pull you underwa­ ter or o the r wise interfere with you r swimming. O the r Strength Checks. The DM might also c all for a Strength check when you try to accom plish tasks like the following: • Force open a stuck, locked, or barred door • Break free of bonds • Push through a tunnel that is too sm all • Hang on to a wagon while being dragged behind it • Tip over a statue • Keep a boulder from rolling

### Attack Rollsand Damage

You add you r Strength m odifier to you r attack roll and you r damage roll when attacking with a melee weapon such as a mace, a battleaxe, or a javelin. You use melee w eapons to make melee attacks in h and-to-h and combat, and some of the m can be thrown to make a ranged attack.

### Liftingand Carrying

Y our Strength score determines the amount of weight you can bear. The following terms define what you can lift or carry. Carrying Capacity. Y our carrying capacity is you r Strength score multiplied by 15. This is the weight (in pounds) that you can carry, which is high enough that most characters don’t usu all y have to worry ab out it. Push, Drag, or Lift. You can push, drag, or lift a weight in pounds up to twice you r carrying capacity (or 30 time s you r Strength score). W hile pushing or dragging weight in excess of you r carrying capacity, you r speed drops to 5 feet. Size and Strength. Larger creatures can bear more weight, whereas Tiny creatures can carry less. For each size category above Medium, double the creature’s carrying capacity and the amount it can push, drag, or lift. For a Tiny creature, halve the se weights. Dexterity m easures agility, reflexes, and balance.

### Dexterity Checks

A Dexterity check can model any attempt to move nimbly, quickly, or quietly, or to keep from f all ing on tricky footing. The Acrobatics, Sleight of H and, and Stealth skills reflect aptitude in certain kinds of Dexterity checks. Acrobatics. Y our Dexterity (Acrobatics) check c over s you r attempt to stay on you r feet in a tricky situation, such as when you’re trying to run across a sheet ofice, balance on a tightrope, or stay upright on a rocking ship’s deck. The DM might also c all for a Dexterity (Acrobatics) check to see if you can per for m acrobatic stunts, including dives, rolls, some rsaults, and flips. Variant : Encumbrance The rules for lifting and carrying are intention all y simple. Here is a variant if you are look ing for more detailed rules for determining how a character is hindered by the weight of equipment. W hen you use this variant, ignore the Strength colum n of the Arm or table in chapter 5. If you carry weight in excess of 5 time s you r Strength score, you are encumbered, which means you r speed drops by 10 feet. If you carry weight in excess of 10 time s you r Strength score, up to you r m aximum carrying capacity, you are instead heavily encumbered, which means you r speed drops by 20 feet and you have disadvantage on ability checks, attack rolls, and saving throws that use Strength, Dexterity, or Constitution.

### Dexterity

Sleight of H and. W henever you attempt an act of legerdemain or manual trickery, such as planting som ething on some one else or concealing an object on you r person, make a Dexterity (Sleight ofH and) check. The DM might also c all for a Dexterity (Sleight of H and) check to determine whe the r you can lift a coin purse of f an o the r person or slip som ething out of an o the r person’s pocket. Stealth. Make a Dexterity (Stealth) check when you attempt to conceal you r self from enemies, slink past guards, slip a way with out being not iced, or sneak up on some one with out being see n or heard. O the r Dexterity Checks. The DM might c all for a Dexterity check when you try to accom plish tasks like the following: • Control a heavily laden cart on a steep descent • Steer a chariot around a tight turn • Pick a lock • Disable a trap • Securely tie up a pris one r • W riggle free of bonds • Play a stringed instrument • Craft a sm all or detailed object

### Attack Rollsand Damage

You add you r Dexterity modifier to you r attack roll and you r damage roll when attacking with a ranged weapon, such as a sling or a longbow. You can also add you r Dexterity m odifier to you r attack roll and you r damage roll when attacking with a melee w eapon that has the finesse property, such as a dagger or a rapier.

### Hiding

When you try to hide, make a Dexterity (Stealth) check. Until you are disc over ed or you stop hiding, that check’s total is contested by the Wisdom (Perception) check of any creature that actively searches for signs of you r presence. You can’t hide from a creature that can see you, and if you make noise (such as sh out ing a warning or knocking over a vase), you give a way you r position. An invisible creature can’t be see n, so it can al way s try to hide. Signs of its passage might still be not iced, how ever, and it still has to stay quiet. In combat, most creatures stay alert for signs of danger all around, so if you come out of hiding and approach a creature, it usu all y see s you. However, under certain circumstances, the Dungeon Master might all ow you to stay hidden as you approach a creature that is distracted, all owing you to gain advantage on an attack be for e you are see n. Passive Perception. When you hide, the re’sachance some one will not ice you even if the y are n't searching. To determine whe the r such a creature not ices you, the DM comp are s you r Dexterity (Stealth) check with that creature’s passive Wisdom (Perception) score, which equals 10 + the creature’s Wisdom modifier, as well as any o the r bon use s or penalties. If the creature has advantage, add 5. For disadvantage, subtract 5. For example, if a 1st-level character (with a proficiency bonus o f +2) has a Wisdom of 15 (a +2 modifier) and proficiency in Perception, he or she has a passive Wisdom (Perception) of 14. What Can You See? One of the main factors in determining whe the r you can find a hidden creature or object is how well you can see in an are a, which might be lightly or heavily obscured, as explained in chapter 8.

### Armor Glass

Depending on the armor you wear, you might add some or all of you r Dexterity m odifier to you r Arm or Class, as described in chapter 5.

### Initiative

At the beginning of every combat, you roll initiative by making a Dexterity check. Initiative determines the order of creatures’ turns in combat, as described in chapter 9.

### Constitution

Constitution m easures health, stamina, and vital for ce.

### Constitution Checks

Constitution checks are uncom m on, and no skills apply to Constitution checks, beca use the endurance this ability represents is largely passive ra the r than involving a specific ef for t on the part of a character or monster. A Constitution check can m odel you r attempt to push beyond normal lim its, how ever. The DM might c all for a Constitution check when you try to accom plish tasks like the following: • Hold you r breath • March or labor for h our s with out rest • Go with out sleep • Survive with out food or water • Quaff an entire stein of ale in one go

### Hit Points

Y our Constitution modifier contributes to you r hit points. Typic all y, you add you r Constitution modifier to each Hit Die you roll for you r hit points. If you r Constitution m odifier changes, you r hit point maximum changes as well, as though you had the new modifier from 1st level. For example, if you raise you r Constitution score when you r each 4th level and you r Constitution m odifier increases from +1 to +2, you ad just you r hit point maximum as though the modifier had al way s been +2. Soyou add 3 hit points for you r first three levels, and the n roll you r hit points for 4th level using you r new modifier. Or if you’re 7th level and some effect lowers you r Constitution score so as to reduce you r Constitution m odifier by 1, you r hit point maximum is reduced by 7.

### Intelligence

Intelligence m easures mental acuity, accuracy of rec all, and the ability to reason.

### Intelligence Checks

An Intelligence check com es into play when you need to draw on logic, education, memory, or deductive reasoning. The Ar can a, History, Investigation, Nature, and Religion skills reflect aptitude in certain kinds of Intelligence checks. Ar can a. Y our Intelligence (Ar can a) check m easures you r ability to rec all lore ab out spells, magic items, eldritch symbols, magical traditions, the planes of existence, and the inhabitants of those planes. History. Y our Intelligence (History) check m easures you r ability to rec all lore ab out historical even ts, legendary people, ancient kingdom s, past disputes, recent wars, and lost civilizations. Investigation. W hen you look around for clues and make deductions based on those clues, you make an Intelligence (Investigation) check. You might deduce the location of a hidden object, discern from the appearance of a wound what kind of weapon dealt it, or determine the weakest point in a tunnel that could ca use it to collapse. Poring through ancient scrolls in search of a hidden fragment of know ledge might also c all for an Intelligence (Investigation) check. Nature. Y our Intelligence (Nature) check m easures you r ability to rec all lore ab out terrain, plants and animals, the wea the r, and natural cycles. Religion. Y our Intelligence (Religion) check m easures you r ability to rec all lore ab out deities, rites and prayers, religious hierarchies, holy symbols, and the practices of secret cults. O the r Intelligence Checks. The DM might c all for an Intelligence check when you try to accom plish tasks like the following: • Communicate with a creature with out using words • Estimate the value of a precious item • Pull toge the radisguise to pass as a city guard • Forge a docum ent • Rec all lore ab out a craft or trade • W in a game of skill

### Spellcasting Ability

W izards use Intelligence as the ir spellcasting ability, which helps determine the saving throw DCs of spells the y cast.

### Wisdom

W isdom reflects how attuned you are to the world around you and represents perceptiveness and intuition.

### Wisdom Checks

AWisdom check might reflect an ef for t to read body language, underst and some one’s feelings, not ice things ab out the environment, or c are for an injured person. The Animal H and ling, Insight, Medicine, Perception, and Survival skills reflect aptitude in certain kinds of W isdom checks. Animal H and ling. W hen the re is any question whe the r you can calm down a domesticated animal, keep a mount from get ting spooked, or intuit an animal’s intentions, the DM might c all for aWisdom (Animal H and ling) check. You also make aWisdom (Animal H and ling) check to control you r mount when you attempt a risky maneuver. Insight. Y our W isdom (Insight) check decides whe the r you can determine the true intentions of a creature, such as w hen searching out a lie or predicting some one’s next move. Doing so involves gleaning clues from body language, speech hab its, and changes in mannerisms. Medicine. AWisdom (Medicine) check lets you try to stabilize a dying com panion or diagnose an illness. Perception. Y our W isdom (Perception) check lets you spot, hear, or o the r wise detect the presence of some thing. It m easures you r general aw are ness of you r surroundings and the keenness of you r senses.

### Findinga Hidden Object

When you r character searches for a hidden object such as a secret door or a trap, the DM typic all y asks you to make a Wisdom (Perception) check. Such a check can be use d to find hidden details or o the r in for mation and clues that you might o the r wise over look. In most cases, you need to describe where you are look ing in order for the DM to determine you r chance of success. For example, a key is hidden beneath a set of folded clo the s in the top drawer of a bureau. If you tell the DM that you pace around the room, look ing at the w all s and furniture for clues, you have no chance of finding the key, regardless of you r Wisdom (Perception) check result. You would have to specify that you were opening the drawers or searching the bureau in order to have any chance of success. For example, you might try to hear a conversation through a closed door, eavesdrop under an open window, or hear monsters moving stealthily in the for est. Or you might try to spot things that are obscured or easy to miss, whe the r the y are orcs lying in ambush on a road, thugs hiding in the shadows of an all ey, or c and lelight under a closed secret door. Survival. The DM might ask you to make aWisdom (Survival) check to follow tracks, hunt wild game, guide you r group through frozen was tel and s, identify signs that owlbears live nearby, predict the wea the r, or avoid quicks and and o the r natural hazards. O the r Wisdom Checks. The DM might c all for a W isdom check when you try to accom plish tasks like the following: • Get a gut feeling ab out what c our se of action to follow • Discern whe the rasee m ingly dead or living creature is undead

### Spellcasting Ability

Clerics, druids, and rangers use W isdom as the ir spellcasting ability, which helps determine the saving throw DCs of spells the y cast.

### Charisma

Charisma m easures you r ability to interact effectively with o the r s. It includes such factors as confidence and eloquence, and it can represent a charm ing or com m and ing personality.

### Charisma Checks

A Charisma check might arise when you try to influence or entertain o the r s, when you try to make an impression or tell a convincing lie, or when you are navigating a tricky social situation. The Deception, Intimidation, Per for m ance, and Persuasion skills reflect aptitude in certain kinds of Charisma checks. Deception. Y our Charisma (Deception) check determines whe the r you can convincingly hide the truth, ei the r verb all y or through you r actions. This deception can encom pass everything from misleading o the rsthrough ambiguity to telling out right lies. Typical situations include trying to fast-talk a guard, con a merchant, earn m one y through gambling, pass you r self of f in a disguise, dull some one’s suspicions with false assurances, or maintain a straight face while telling a blatant lie. Intimidation. W hen you attempt to influence some one through over t threats, hostile actions, and physical violence, the DM might ask you to make a Charisma (Intimidation) check. Examples include trying to pry in for mation out of a pris one r, convincing street thugs to back down from a confrontation, or using the edge of a broken bottle to convince a sneering vizier to reconsider a decision. Per for mance. Y our Charisma (Per for m ance) check determines how well you can delight an audience with music, dance, acting, storytelling, or some o the r for m of entertainment. Persuasion. W hen you attempt to influence some one or a group ofpeople with tact, social graces, or good nature, the DM might ask you to make a Charisma (Persuasion) check. Typic all y, you use persuasion when acting in good faith, to foster friendships, make cordial requests, or exhibit proper etiquette. Examples of persuading o the rsinclude convincing a chamberlain to let you r party see the king, negotiating peace between warring tribes, or inspiring a crowd of townsfolk. O the r Charisma Checks. The DM might c all for a Charisma check when you try to accom plish tasks like the following: • Find the best person to talk to for new s, rumors, and gossip • Blend into a crowd to get the sense ofkey topics ofconversation

### Spellcasting Ability

Bards, paladins, sorcerers, and w arlocks use Charisma as the ir spellcasting ability, which helps determine the saving throw DCs of spells the y cast. Sa v in gThrows A saving throw—also c all ed a save—represents an attempt to resist a spell, a trap, a poison, a disease, or a similar threat. You don’t norm all y decide to make a saving throw; you are for ced to make one beca use you r character or monster is at risk of harm. To make a saving throw, roll a d20 and add the appropriate ability modifier. For example, you use you r Dexterity modifier for a Dexterity saving throw. A saving throw can be modified by a situational bonus or penalty and can be affected by advantage and disadvantage, as determined by the DM. Each class give s proficiency in at least two saving throws. The wizard, for example, is proficient in Intelligence saves. As with skill proficiencies, proficiency in a saving throw lets a character add his or her proficiency bonus to saving throws made using a particular ability score. Som e monsters have saving throw proficiencies as well. The Difficulty Class for a saving throw is determined by the effect that ca use s it. For example, the DC for a saving throw all owed by a spell is determined by the caster’s spellcasting ability and proficiency bonus. The result of a successful or failed saving throw is also detailed in the effect that all ows the save. Usu all y, a successful save m eans that a creature suffers no harm, or reduced harm, from an effect.

## 8. Adventuring

### Movement

DELVING INTO THE ANCIENT TOMB OF HORRORS. slipping through the back all eys of Waterdeep, hacking a fresh trail through the thick jungles on the Isle of Dread—the se are the things that Dungeons & Dragons adventures are made of. Y our character in the game might explore for gotten ruins and uncharted l and s, unc over dark secrets and sinister plots, and slay foul monsters. And if all goes well, you r character will survive to claim rich rewards be for e embarking on a new adventure. This chapter c over s the basics of the adventuring life, from the m echanics of movement to the complexities of social interaction. The rules for resting are also in this chapter, along with a discussion of the activities you r character might pursue between adventures. W he the r adventurers are exploring a dusty dungeon or the com plex relationships of a royal c our t, the game follows a natural rhythm, as out lined in the book’s introduction: 1. The DM describes the environment. 2. The players describe what the y want to do. 3. The DM narrates the results of the ir actions. Typic all y, the DM use samap as an out line of the adventure, tracking the characters’ progress as the y explore dungeon corridors or wilderness regions. The DM ’s not es, including a key to the map, describe what the adventurers find as the y enter each new are a. Som etim es, the passage of time and the adventurers’ actions determine what happens, so the DM might use a time line or a flowchart to track the ir progress instead of a map. T im e In situations where keeping track of the passage of time is important, the DM determines the time a task requires. The DM might use a different time scale depending on the context of the situation at h and. In a dungeon environment, the adventurers’ movement happens on a scale of minutes. It take s the m ab out a minute to creep down a long h all way, an o the r minute to check for traps on the door at the end of the h all, and a good ten minutes to search the cham ber beyond for any thing interesting or valuable. In a city or wilderness, a scale of h our s is of ten more appropriate. Adventurers eager to r each the l one ly tower at the heart of the for est hurry across those fifteen miles in just under f our h our s’ time. For long j our neys, a scale of day s works best. Following the road from Baldur’s Gate to Waterdeep, the adventurers spend f our un even tful day s be for eagoblin ambush interrupts the ir j our ney. In combat and o the r fast-paced situations, the game relies on rounds, a 6-second span of time described in chapter 9. Swim m ing across a rushing river, sneaking down a dungeon corridor, scaling a tr each erous mountain s lo p e - all sorts of movement play a key role in D&D adventures. The DM can sum m arize the adventurers’ movement with out calculating exact distances or travel time s: “You travel through the for est and find the dungeon entrance late in the even ing of the third day.” Even in a dungeon, particularly a large dungeon or a cave ne two rk, the DM can summ arize movement between encounters: “After killing the guardian at the entrance to the ancient dwarven stronghold, you consult you r map, which leads you through miles of echoing corridors to achas m bridged by a narrow st one arch.” Som etim es it’s important, though, to know how long it take s to get from one spot to an o the r, whe the r the answer is in day s, h our s, or minutes. The rules for determining travel time depend on two factors: the speed and travel pace of the creatures moving and the terrain the y're moving over.

### Speed

Every character and monster has a speed, which is the distance in feet that the character or monster can walk in 1 round. This number assum es short bursts of ener get ic movement in the midst of a life- threatening situation. The following rules determine how far a character or monster can move in a minute, an h our, or a day. Travel Pa c e W hile traveling, a group of adventurers can move at a normal, fast, or slow pace, as s how n on the Travel Pace table. The table states how far the party can move in a period of time and whe the r the pace has any effect. A fast pace m akes characters less perceptive, while a slow pace make s it possible to sneak around and to search an are a more c are fully (see the “Activity W hile Traveling” section later in this chapter for more in for mation). Forced March. The Travel Pace table assum es that characters travel for 8 h our s in day. They can push on beyond that limit, at the risk of exhaustion. For each additional h our of travel beyond 8 h our s, the characters c over the distance s how n in the H our colum n for the ir pace, and each character must make a Constitution saving throw at the end of the h our. The DC is 10 + 1 for each h our past 8 h our s. On a failed saving throw, a character suffers one level of exhaustion (see appendix A). Mounts and Vehicles. For short spans of time (up to an h our), m any animals move much faster than humanoids. A mounted character can ride at agall op for ab out an h our, c over ing twice the usual distance for a fast pace. If fresh mounts are available every 8 to 10 miles, characters can c over larger distances at this pace, but this is very r are except in densely populated are as. Characters in wagons, carriages, or o the rland vehicles choose a pace as normal. Characters in a waterborne vessel are limited to the speed of the vessel (see chapter 5), and the y don’t suffer penalties for a fast pace or gain benef its from a slow pace. Depending on the vessel and the size of the crew, ships might be able to travel for up to 24 h our s per day. Certain special mounts, such as a pegasus or griffon, or special vehicles, such as a carpet of flying, all ow you to travel more swiftly. The Dungeon Master’s Guide contains more in for mation on special m ethods of travel.

### Difficult Terrain

The travel speeds give n in the Travel Pace table assume relatively simple terrain: roads, open plains, or clear dungeon corridors. But adventurers of ten face dense for ests, deep swamps, rubble-filled ruins, steep mountains, and ice-c over ed ground—all considered difficult terrain. You move at half speed in difficult terrain—moving 1 foot in difficult terrain costs 2 feet of speed—so you can c over only half the normal distance in a minute, an h our, or a day.

### Special Typesof Movement

Movement through dangerous dungeons or wilderness are as of ten involves more than simply walking. Adventurers might have to climb, crawl, swim, or jum p to get where the y need to go. Climbing , Swimming , and Crawling W hile climbing or swimming, each foot of movement costs 1 extra foot (2 extra feet in difficult terrain), unless a creature has a climbing or swim m ing speed. At the DM ’s option, clim bing a slippery vertical surface or one with few h and holds requires a successful Strength (Athletics) check. Similarly, gaining any distance in rough water might require a successful Strength (Athletics) check.

### Jumping

Y our Strength determines how far you can jump. Long Jump. W hen you make a long jump, you c over a number of feet up to you r Strength score if you move at least 10 feet on foot immediately be for e the jump. W hen you make a st and ing long jump, you can leap only half that distance. Ei the r way, each foot you clear on the jum p costs a foot of movement. This rule assum es that the height of you r jum p doesn’t matter, such as a jum p across a stream or c has m. At you r DM ’s option, you must succeed on a DC 10 Strength (Athletics) check to clear a low obstacle (no t all er than a quarter of the jum p’s distance), such as a hedge or low w all. O the rwise, you hit it. W hen you l and in difficult terrain, you must succeed on a DC 10 Dexterity (Acrobatics) check to l and on you r feet. O the rwise, you l and pr one. High Jump. W hen you make a high jump, you leap into the air a num ber of feet equal to 3 + you r Strength m odifier if you move at least 10 feet on foot immediately be for e the jump. W hen you make a st and ing high jump, you can jum p only half that distance. Ei the r way, each foot you clear on the jum p costs a foot ofmovement. In some circum stances, you r DM might all ow you to make a Strength (Athletics) check to jum p higher than you norm all y can. You can extend you r arms half you r height above you r self during the jump. Thus, you can r each above you a distance equal to the height of the jum p plus 1 1/2 time s you r height.

### Activity While Traveling

As adventurers travel through a dungeon or the wilderness, the y need to remain alert for danger, and some characters might per for mothe r tasks to help the group’sjour ney.

### Marching Order

The adventurers should establish amarching order. Amarching order make s it easier to determine which characters are affected by traps, which one s can spot hidden enemies, and which one s are the closest to those enem ies when a fight breaks out. A character might occupy the front rank, one or more middle ranks, or the back rank. Characters in the front and back ranks need enough room to travel side by side with o the rsin the ir rank. W hen space is too tight, the marching order must change, usu all y by moving characters to a middle rank. Fewer Than Three Ranks. If an adventuring party arranges its marching order with only two ranks, the y are a front rank and a back rank. If the re’s only one rank, it’s considered a front rank. St ealth W hile traveling at a slow pace, the characters can move stealthily. As long as the y’re not in the open, the y can try to surprise or sneak by o the r creatures the y encounter. S ee the rules for hiding in chapter 7.

### Noticing Threats

Use the passive W isdom (Perception) scores of the characters to determine whe the r any one in the group not ices a hidden threat. The DM might decide that a threat can be not iced only by characters in a particular rank. For example, as the characters are exploring a maze oftunnels, the DM might decide that only those characters in the back rank have a chance to hear or spot a stealthy creature following the group, while characters in the front and middle ranks can not. W hile traveling at a fast pace, characters take a - 5 penalty to the ir passive W isdom (Perception) scores to not ice hidden threats.

### Travel Pace

Pace Distance Traveled per... Effect Minute Hour Day Fast 400 feet 4 miles 30 miles -5 penalty to passive Wisdom (Perception) scores Normal 300 feet 3 miles 24 miles — Slow 200 feet 2 miles 18 miles Able to use stealth Encountering Creatures. If the DM determines that the adventurers encounter o the r creatures while the y’re traveling, it’s up to both groups to decide what happens next. Ei the r group might decide to attack, initiate a conversation, run a way, or wait to see what the o the r group does. Surprising Foes. If the adventurers encounter a hostile creature or group, the DM determines whe the r the adventurers or the ir foes might be surprised when com bat erupts. S ee chapter 9 for more ab out surprise.

### Other Activities

Characters w ho turn the ir attention to o the r tasks as the group travels are not foc use d on watching for danger. These characters don’t contribute the ir passive W isdom (Perception) scores to the group’s chance of not icing hidden threats. However, a character not watching for danger can do one of the following activities instead, or some o the r activity with the DM ’s permission. Navigate. The character can try to pr even t the group from becom ing lost, making aWisdom (Survival) check when the DM c all s for it. (The Dungeon Master’s Guide has rules to determine whe the r the group get s lost.) Draw a Map. The character can draw a map that records the group’s progress and helps the characters get back on c our se if the y get lost. No ability check is required. Track. A character can follow the tracks of an o the r creature, making aWisdom (Survival) check when the DM c all s for it. (The Dungeon Master’s Guide has rules for tracking.) Forage. The character can keep an eye out for ready s our ces of food and water, making aWisdom (Survival) check when the DM c all s for it. (The Dungeon Master’s Guide has rules for for aging.)

### The Environment

By its nature, adventuring involves delving into places that are dark, dangerous, and full of mysteries to be explored. The rules in this section c over some of the most important way s in w hich adventurers interact with the environment in such places. The Dungeon Master’s Guide has rules c over ing more unusual situations.

### Falling

Afall from a great height is one of the most com m on hazards facing an adventurer. At the end of afall, a creature take s 1d6 bludgeoning damage for every 10 feet it fell, to a maximum of 20d6. The creature l and s pr one, unless it avoids taking damage from the f all.

### Suffocating

A creature can hold its breath for a number of minutes equal to 1 + its Constitution modifier (minimum of 30 seconds). W hen a creature runs out of breath, it can survive for a number ofrounds equal to its Constitution modifier (minimum 1 round). At the start of its next turn, it drops to 0 hit points and is dying. SplittingUp the Pa rty Some time s, it make s sense to split an adventuring party, especi all y if you want one or more characters to sc out ahead. You can for m multiple parties, each moving at a different speed. Each group has its own front, middle, and back ranks. The draw back to this approach is that the party will be split into several sm all er groups in the even t of an attack. The advantage is that a sm all group of stealthy characters moving slowly might be able to sneak past enemies that clumsier characters would alert. A rogue and a monk moving at a slow pace are much harder to detect when the y leave the ir dwarf paladin friend behind. For example, a creature with a Constitution of 14 can hold its breath for 3 minutes. If it starts suffocating, it has 2 rounds to r each air be for e it drops to 0 hit points.

### Visionand Light

The m ost fundamental tasks of adventuring—not icing danger, finding hidden objects, hitting an enemy in combat, and tar get ing a spell, to name just a few— rely heavily on a character’s ability to see. Darkness and o the r effects that obscure vision can prove a signifi can t hindrance. A give n are a might be lightly or heavily obscured. In a lightly obscured are a, such as dim light, patchy fog, or moderate foliage, creatures have disadvantage on W isdom (Perception) checks that rely on sight. A heavily obscured are a—such as darkness, opaque fog, or dense foliage—blocks vision entirely. A creature in a heavily obscured are a effectively suffers from the blinded condition (see appendix A). The presence or absence of light in an environment creates three categories of illumination: bright light, dim light, and darkness. Bright light lets most creatures see norm all y. Even gloom y day s provide bright light, as do torches, lanterns, fires, and o the rsour ces of illumination with in a specific radius. Dim light, also c all ed shadows, creates a lightly obscured are a. An are aof dim light is usu all y a boundary between asour ce of bright light, such as a torch, and surrounding darkness. The soft light of twilight and dawn also counts as dim light. A particularly brilliant full m oon might ba the the l and in dim light. Darkness creates a heavily obscured are a. Characters face darkness out doors at night (even most moonlit nights), with in the confines of an unlit dungeon or a subterranean vault, or in an are a of m agical darkness.

### Blindsight

A creature with blindsight can perceive its surroundings with out relying on sight, with in a specific radius. Creatures with out eyes, such as oozes, and creatures with echolocation or heightened senses, such as bats and true dragons, have this sense.

### Darkvision

M any creatures in the w orlds of D&D, especi all y those that d well underground, have darkvision. Within a specified range, a creature with darkvision can see in darkness as if the darkness were dim light, so are as of darkness are only lightly obscured as far as that creature is concerned. However, the creature can’t discern color in darkness, only shades of gray.

### Truesight

A creature with truesight can, out to a specific range, see in normal and magical darkness, see invisible creatures and objects, automatic all y detect visual illusions and succeed on saving throws against the m, and perceives the original for m of a shapechanger or a creature that is trans for med by magic. Fur the r more, the creature can see into the E the real Plane.

### Foodand Water

Characters who don’t eat or drink suffer the effects of exhaustion (see appendix A). Exhaustion ca use d by lack of food or water can’t be removed until the character eats and drinks the full required amount.

### Food

A character needs one pound of food per day and can m ake food last longer by subsisting on half rations. Eating half a pound of food in a day counts as half a day with out food. A character can go with out food for a number of day s equal to 3 + his or her Constitution modifier (minimum 1). At the end ofeach day beyond that limit, a character automatic all y suffers one level of exhaustion. A normal day of eating resets the count of day s with out food to zero.

### Water

A character needs one g all on of water per day, or two g all ons per day if the wea the r is hot. A character who drinks only half that much water must succeed on a DC 15 Constitution saving throw or suffer one level of exhaustion at the end of the day. A character with access to even less water automatic all y suffers one level of exhaustion at the end ofthe day. If the character already has one or more levels of exhaustion, the character take s two levels in ei the r case.

### Interactingwith Objects

A character’s interaction with objects in an environment is of ten simple to resolve in the game. The player tells the DM that his or her character is doing some thing, such a moving a lever, and the DM describes what, if any thing happens. For example, a character might decide to pull a lever, which might, in turn, raise a portcullis, ca use a room to flood with water, or open a secret door in a nearby w all. If the lever is rusted in position, though, a character might need to for ce it. In such a situation, the DM might c all for a Strength check to see whe the r the character can wrench the lever into place. The DM sets the DC for any such check based on the difficulty of the task. Characters can also damage objects with the ir w eapons and spells. Objects are immune to poison and psychic damage, but o the r wise the y can be affected by physical and magical attacks much like creatures can. The DM determines an object’s Arm or Class and hit points, and might decide that certain objects have resistance or immunity to certain kinds of attacks. (It’s hard to cut a rope with a club, for example.) Objects al way s fail Strength and Dexterity saving throws, and the y are immune to effects that require o the r saves. W hen an object drops to 0 hit points, it breaks. A character can also attempt a Strength check to break an object. The DM sets the DC for any such check. So cial In teract io n Exploring dungeons, over com ing obstacles, and slaying m onsters are key parts of D&D adventures. No less important, though, are the social interactions that adventurers have with o the r inhabitants of the world. Interaction take s on m any for ms. You might need to convince an unscrupulous thief to confess to some m alfeasance, or you might try to flatter a dragon so that it will sp are you r life. The DM assum es the roles of any characters w ho are participating in the interaction that don’t belong to an o the r player at the table. Any such character is c all ed a nonplayer character (NPC). In general terms, an N PC ’s attitude toward you is described as friendly, indifferent, or hostile. Friendly NPCs are predisposed to help you, and hostile one s are inclined to get in you r way. It’s easier to get what you want from a friendly NPC, ofc our se. Social interactions have two primary aspects: roleplaying and ability checks.

### Roleplaying

Roleplaying is, liter all y, the act of playing out a role. In this case, it’s you as a player determining how you r character think s, acts, and talks. Roleplaying is a part of every aspect ofthe game, and it com es to the for e during social interactions. Y our character’s quirks, mannerisms, and personality influence how interactions resolve. There are two styles you can use when roleplaying you r character: the descriptive approach and the active approach. Most players use a combination of the two styles. Use which ever m ix of the two works best for you.

### Descriptive Approachto Roleplaying

W ith this approach, you describe you r character’swords and actions to the DM and the o the r players. Drawing on you r mental image of you r character, you tell every one what you r character does and how he or she does it. For instance, Chris plays Tordek the dwarf. Tordek has a quick temper and blam es the elves of the Cloakwood for his family’s mis for tune. At a tavern, an obnoxious elf minstrel s its at Tordek’s table and tries to strike up a conversation with the dwarf. Chris says, “Tordek sp its on the floor, growls an insult at the bard, and stomps over to the bar. He s its on a stool and gl are s at the minstrel be for e ordering an o the r drink.” In this example, Chris has conveyed Tordek’smood and give n the DM a clear idea of his character’s attitude and actions. W hen using descriptive roleplaying, keep the following things in mind: • D escribe you r character’s em otions and attitude. • Focus on you r character’s intent and how o the r s might perceive it. • Provide as much embellishment as you feel com for table with. D on’tworry ab out get ting things exactly right. Just focus on think ing ab out what you r character would do and describing what you see in you r mind.

### Active Approachto Roleplaying

If descriptive roleplaying tells you r DM and you r fellow players what you r character think s and does, active roleplaying s how s the m. W hen you use active roleplaying, you speak with you r character’s voice, like an actor taking on a role. You might even echo you r character’s movements and body language. This approach is more im mersive than descriptive roleplaying, though you still need to describe things that can’t be reasonably acted out. Going back to the example of Chris roleplaying Tordek above, here’s how the scene might play out if Chris use d active roleplaying: Speaking as Tordek, Chris says in a gruff, deep voice, “I was w ondering why it suddenly sm elled awful in here. If I want ed to hear any thing out ofyou, I'd snap you r arm and enjoy you r scream s.” In his normal voice, Chris the n adds, “I get up, gl are at the elf, and head to the bar.”

### Resultsof Roleplaying

The DM use s you r character’s actions and attitudes to determine how an NPC reacts. A cowardly NPC buckles under threats of violence. A stubborn dwarf ref use s to let any one badger her. A vain dragon laps up flattery. W hen interacting with an NPC, pay close attention to the DM ’s portrayal ofthe N PC ’smood, dialogue, and personality. You might be able to determine an N PC ’s personality tra its, ideals, flaws, and bonds, the n play on the m to influence the N PC ’s attitude. Interactions in D&D are much like interactions in real life. If you can of fer N PCs som ething the y want, threaten the m with som ething the y fear, or play on the ir sympathies and goals, you can use words to get al most any thing you want. On the o the rhand, if you insult a proud w arrior or speak ill of a noble’s all ies, you r ef for ts to convince or deceive will f all short.

### Ability Checks

In addition to roleplaying, ability checks are key in determining the out com e of an interaction. Y our roleplaying ef for ts can alter an N PC’s attitude, but the re might still be an element of chance in the situation. For example, you r DM can c all for a Charisma check at any point during an interaction if he or she want s the dice to play a role in determining an N PC ’s reactions. O the r checks might be appropriate in certain situations, at you r DM ’s discretion. Pay attention to you r skill proficiencies when think ing of how you want to interact with an NPC, and stack the deck in you r favor by using an approach that relies on you r best bon use s and skills. If the group needs to trick a guard into letting the m into a castle, the rogue w ho is proficient in Deception is the best bet to lead the discussion. W hen negotiating for a hostage’s release, the cleric with Persuasion should do most of the talking. Rest in g H eroic though the y might be, adventurers can’t spend every h our ofthe day in the thick of exploration, social interaction, and combat. They need rest—time to sleep and eat, tend the ir wounds, refresh the ir minds and spir its for spellcasting, and brace the mselves for fur the r adventure. Adventurers can take short rests in the midst of an adventuring day and a long rest to end the day.

### Short Rest

A short rest is a period of down time, at least 1 h our long, during which a character does not hing more strenuous than eating, drinking, reading, and tending to wounds. A character can spend one or more Hit Dice at the end of a short rest, up to the character’s maximum number of Hit Dice, which is equal to the character's level. For each Hit Die spent in this way, the player rolls the die and adds the character’s Constitution modifier to it. The character regains hit points equal to the total. The player can decide to spend an additional Hit Die after each roll. A character regains some spent Hit Dice upon finishing a long rest, as explained below.

### Long Rest

A long rest is a period of extended down time, at least 8 h our s long, during which a character sleeps or per for m s light activity: reading, talking, eating, or st and ing watch for no more than 2 h our s. If the rest is interrupted by a period of strenuous activity—at least 1 h our of walking, fighting, casting spells, or similar adventuring activity— the characters must begin the rest again to gain any benefit from it. At the end of a long rest, a character regains all lost hit points. The character also regains spent Hit Dice, up to a number of dice equal to half of the character’s total number of the m. For example, if a character has eight Hit Dice, he or she can regain f our spent Hit Dice upon finishing a long rest. A character can’t benefit from more than one long rest in a 24-h our period, and a character must have at least 1 hit point at the start of the rest to gain its benef its.

### Between Adventures

Between trips to dungeons and battles against ancient evils, adventurers need time to rest, recuperate, and prep are for the ir next adventure. M any adventurers also use this time to per for mothe r tasks, such as crafting arms and armor, per for m ing research, or spending the ir hard-earned gold. In some cases, the passage oftime is som ething that occurs with little fanf are or description. W hen starting a new adventure, the DM might simply decl are that a certain amount of time has passed and all ow you to describe in general terms what you r character has been doing. At o the r time s, the DM might want to keep track of just how much time is passing as even ts beyond you r perception stay in motion.

### Lifestyle Expenses

Between adventures, you choose a particular quality of life and pay the cost of maintaining that lifestyle, as described in chapter 5. Living a particular lifestyle doesn’t have a huge effect on you r character, but you r lifestyle can affect the way o the r individuals and groups react to you. For example, when you lead an aristocratic lifestyle, it might be easier for you to influence the nobles of the city than if you live in p over ty.

### Downtime Activities

Between adventures, the DM might ask you what you r character is doing during his or her down time. Periods of down time can vary in duration, but each down time activity requires a certain number of day s to complete be for e you gain any benefit, and at least 8 h our s of each day must be spent on the down time activity for the day to count. The day s do not need to be consecutive. If you have more than the minim um amount of day s to spend, you can keep doing the same thing for a longer period of time, or switch to a new down time activity. Downtim e activities o the r than the one s presented below are possible. If you want you r character to spend his or her down time per for m ing an activity not c over ed here, discuss it with you r DM.

### Crafting

You can craft nonm agical objects, including adventuring equipment and w orks of art. You must be proficient with tools related to the object you are trying to create (typic all y artisan’s tools). You might also need access to special materials or locations necessary to create it. For example, some one proficient with smith’s tools needs a for ge in order to craft a sword or suit of armor. For every day of down time you spend crafting, you can craft one or more items with a total market value not exceeding 5 gp, and you must expend raw materials worth half the total market value. If som ething you want to craft has a market value greater than 5 gp, you make progress every day in 5-gp increments until you r each the market value of the item. For example, a suit of plate arm or (market value 1,500 gp) take s 300 day s to craft by you r self. Multiple characters can com bine the ir ef for ts toward the crafting of a single item, provided that the characters all have proficiency with the requisite tools and are working toge the r in the same place. Each character contributes 5 gp worth of ef for t for every day spent helping to craft the item. For example, three characters with the requisite tool proficiency and the proper facilities can craft a suit ofplate armor in 100 day s, at a total cost o f 750 gp. W hile crafting, you can maintain amodest lifestyle with out having to pay 1 gp per day, or a com for table lifestyle at half the normal cost (see chapter 5 for more in for mation on lifestyle expenses).

### Practicinga Profession

You can work between adventures, all owing you to maintain a modest lifestyle with out having to pay 1 gp per day (see chapter 5 for more in for mation on lifestyle expenses). This benefit lasts as long you continue to practice you r profession. If you are amem ber of an organization that can provide gainful employment, such as a temple or a thieves’ guild, you earn enough to support a com for table lifestyle instead. If you have proficiency in the Per for m ance skill and put you r per for m ance skill to use during you r down time, you earn enough to support a wealthy lifestyle instead.

### Recuperating

You can use down time between adventures to rec over from a debilitating injury, disease, or poison. After three day s of down time spent recuperating, you can make a DC 15 Constitution saving throw. On a successful save, you can choose one of the following results: • End one effect on you that pr even ts you from regain­ ing hit points. • For the next 24 h our s, gain advantage on saving throws against one disease or poison currently affecting you.

### Researching

The time between adventures is a great chance to per for m research, gaining insight into mysteries that have unfurled over the c our se ofthe campaign. Research can include poring over dusty tom es and crumbling scrolls in a library or buying drinks for the locals to pry rum ors and gossip from the ir lips. W hen you begin you r research, the DM determines whe the r the in for mation is available, how m any day s of down time it will take to find it, and whe the r the re are any restrictions on you r research (such as needing to see k out a specific individual, tome, or location). The DM might also require you to make one or more ability checks, such as an Intelligence (Investigation) check to find clues pointing toward the in for mation you see k, or a Charisma (Persuasion) check to secure some one’s aid. Once those conditions are met, you learn the in for mation if it is available. For each day of research, you must spend 1 gp to c over you r expenses. This cost is in addition to you r normal lifestyle expenses (as discussed in chapter 5).

### Training

You can spend time between adventures learning a new language or training with a set of tools. Y our DM might all ow additional training options. First, you must find an instructor will ing to t each you. The DM determines how long it take s, and whe the r one or more ability checks are required. The training lasts for 250 day s and costs 1 gp per day. After you spend the requisite amount of time and m one y, you learn the new language or gain proficiency with the new tool.

## 9. Combat

### Surprise

THE CLATTER OF A SWORD STRIKING AGAINST a shield. The terrible rending sound as m onstrous claws tear through armor. A brilliant flash of light as aball of flame blossom s from awizard’s spell. The sharp tang of blood in the air, cutting through the stench of vile monsters. Roars of fury, sh out s of triumph, cries of pain. Combat in D&D can be chaotic, deadly, and thrilling. This chapter provides the rules you need for you r characters and m onsters to engage in combat, whe the r it is a brief skirm ish or an extended conflict in a dungeon or on a field ofbattle. Through out this chapter, the rules address you, the player or Dungeon Master. The Dungeon Master controls all the monsters and nonplayer characters involved in combat, and each o the r player controls an adventurer. “You” can also mean the character or monster that you control. TheO rder of Combat A typical com bat encounter is a clash between two sides, a flurry of w eapon swings, feints, parries, foo two rk, and spellcasting. The game organizes the chaos of combat into a cycle of rounds and turns. A round represents ab out 6 seconds in the game world. During a round, each participant in a battle take s a turn. The order of turns is determined at the beginning of a com bat encounter, when every one rolls initiative. Once every one has take naturn, the fight continues to the next round if nei the r side has defeated the o the r. Aband of adventurers sneaks up on aband it camp, springing from the trees to attack the m. A gelatinous cube glides down a dungeon passage, un not iced by the adventurers until the cube engulfs one of the m. In the se situations, one side of the battle gains surprise over the o the r. The DM determines w ho might be surprised. If nei the r side tries to be stealthy, the y automatic all y not ice each o the r. O the rwise, the DM com p are s the Dexterity (Stealth) checks of any one hiding with the passive W isdom (Perception) score of each creature on the

### Combat Stepby Step

1. Determine surprise. The DM determines whe the r any one involved in the combat encounter is surprised. 2. Establish positions. The DM decides where all the characters and monsters are located. Given the adventurers’ marching order or the ir stated positions in the room or o the r location, the DM figures out where the adversaries are— how far a way and in what direction. 3. Roll initiative. Every one involved in the combat encounter rolls initiative, determining the order of combatants’ turns. 4. Take turns. Each participant in the battle take saturn in initiative order. 5. Begin the next round. When every one involved in the combat has had a turn, the round ends. Repeat step 4 until the fighting stops. opposing side. Any character or monster that doesn’t not ice a threat is surprised at the start of the encounter. If you’re surprised, you can’t move or take an action on you r first turn of the combat, and you can’t take a reaction until that turn ends. Amem ber of a group can be surprised even if the o the rmem bers are n’t.

### Initiative

Initiative determines the order of turns during combat. W hen combat starts, every participant make s a Dexterity check to determine the ir place in the initiative order. The DM make s one roll for an entire group of identical creatures, so each m em ber of the group acts at the same time. The DM ranks the combatants in order from the one with the highest Dexterity check total to the one with the lowest. This is the order (c all ed the initiative order) in which the y act during each round. The initiative order remains the same from round to round. If a tie occurs, the DM decides the order among tied DM-controlled creatures, and the players decide the order am ong the ir tied characters. The DM can decide the order if the tie is between a monster and a player character. Option all y, the DM can have the tied characters and monsters each roll a d20 to determine the order, highest roll going first.

### Your Turn

On you r turn, you can move a distance up to you r speed and take one action. You decide whe the r to move first or take you r action first. Y our speed—som etim es c all ed you r walking speed—is not ed on you r character sheet. The most com m on actions you can take are described in the “Actions in Com bat” section later in this chapter. M any class features and o the r abilities provide additional options for you r action. The “Movement and Position” section later in this chapter give s the rules for you r move. You can for go moving, taking an action, or doing any thing at all on you r turn. If you can’t decide what to do on you r turn, consider taking the Dodge or Ready action, as described in “Actions in Combat.”

### Bonus Actions

Various class features, spells, and o the r abilities let you take an additional action on you r turn c all ed a bonus action. The Cunning Action feature, for example, all ows a rogue to take a bonus action. You can take a bonus action only when a special ability, spell, or o the r feature of the game states that you can do som ething as a bonus action. You o the r wise don’t have a bonus action to take. You can take only one bonus action on you r turn, so you must choose which bonus action to use w hen you have more than one available. You choose when to take a bonus action during you r turn, unless the bonus action’s timing is specified, and any thing that deprives you of you r ability to take actions also pr even ts you from taking a bonus action.

### Other Activityon Your Turn

Y our turn can include a variety of fl our ishes that require nei the r you r action nor you r move. You can com m unicate how ever you are able, through brief utterances and gestures, as you take you r turn. You can also interact with one object or feature of the environment for free, during ei the r you r move or you r action. For example, you could open a door during you r move as you stride toward a foe, or you could draw you r weapon as part of the sam e action you use to attack. If you want to interact with a second object, you need to use you r action. S om e magic items and o the r special objects al way s require an action to use, as stated in the ir descriptions. The DM might require you to use an action for any of the se activities w hen it needs special c are or when it presents an unusual obstacle. For instance, the DM could reasonably expect you to use an action to open a stuck door or turn a crank to lower a drawbridge.

### Reactions

Certain special abilities, spells, and situations all ow you to take a special action c all ed a reaction. A reaction is an instant response to a trigger of some kind, which can occur on you r turn or on some one else’s. The opportunity attack, described later in this chapter, is the most com m on type of reaction. W hen you take a reaction, you can’t take an o the r one until the start of you r next turn. If the reaction interrupts an o the r creature’s turn, that creature can continue its turn right after the reaction. Movement and Po s it io n In combat, characters and m onsters are in constant motion, of ten using movement and position to gain the upper h and.

### Interactingwith Objects Around You

Here are a few examples of the sorts of thing you can do in t and em with you r movement and action: • draw or shea the a sword • open or close a door • with draw a potion from you r back pack • pick up a dropped axe • take a bauble from a table • remove a ring from you r finger • stuff some food into you r m out h • plant a banner in the ground • fish a few coins from you r belt pouch • drink all the ale in a flagon • throw a lever or a switch • pull a torch from a sconce • take a book from a shelf you can r each • extinguish a sm all flame • don a mask • pull the hood of you r cloak up and over you r head • put you r ear to a door • kick a sm all st one • turn a key in a lock • tap the floor with a 10-foot pole • h and an item to an o the r character On you r turn, you can move a distance up to you r speed. You can use as much or as little of you r speed as you like on you r turn, following the rules here. Y our movement can include jumping, climbing, and swimming. These different m odes of movement can be com bined with walking, or the y can constitute you r entire move. However you’re moving, you deduct the distance of each part of you r move from you r speed until it is use d up or until you are d one moving. The “Special Types of Movement’’ section in chapter 8 give s the particulars for jumping, climbing, and swimming.

### Breaking Up Your Move

You can break up you r movement on you r turn, using some of you r speed be for e and after you r action. For example, if you have a speed of 30 feet, you can move 10 feet, take you r action, and the n move 20 feet.

### Movingbetween Attacks

If you take an action that includes more than one weapon attack, you can break up you r movement even fur the r by moving between those attacks. For example, a fighter w ho can make two attacks with the Extra Attack feature and who has a speed of 25 feet could move 10 feet, make an attack, move 15 feet, and the n attack again. Usin gDifferentSpeeds If you have more than one speed, such as you r walking speed and a flying speed, you can switch back and for th between you r speeds during you r move. W henever you switch, subtract the distance you've already m oved from the new speed. The result determines how much far the r you can move. If the result is 0 or less, you can’t use the new speed during the current move. For example, if you have a speed of 30 and a flying speed of 60 beca use a wizard cast the fly spell on you, you could fly 20 feet, the n walk 10 feet, and the n leap into the air to fly 30 feet more.

### Difficult Terrain

Combat r are ly take s place in b are room s or on featureless plains. Boulder-strewn caverns, briar- choked for ests, tr each erous staircases—the setting of a typical fight contains difficult terrain. Every foot of movement in difficult terrain costs 1 extra foot. This rule is true even if multiple things in a space count as difficult terrain. Low furniture, rubble, undergrowth, steep stairs, snow, and sh all ow bogs are examples ofdifficult terrain. The space of an o the r creature, whe the r hostile or not, also counts as difficult terrain.

### Being Prone

Combatants of ten find the mselves lying on the ground, ei the r beca use the y are knocked down or beca use the y throw the mselves down. In the game, the y are pr one, a condition described in appendix A. You can drop pr one with out using any of you r speed. St and ing up take s more ef for t; doing so costs an amount of movement equal to half you r speed. For example, if you r speed is 30 feet, you must spend 15 feet of movement to st and up. You can’t st and up if you don’t have enough movement left or if you r speed is 0. To move while pr one, you must crawl or use magic such as teleportation. Every foot of movement while crawling costs 1 extra foot. Crawling 1 foot in difficult terrain, the re for e, costs 3 feet of movement.

### Moving Around Other

### Creatures

You can move through a nonhostile creature’s space. In contrast, you can move through a hostile creature's space only if the creature is at least two sizes larger or sm all er than you. Rem em ber that an o the r creature’s space is difficult terrain for you. W he the racreature is a friend or an enemy, you can’t will ingly end you r move in its space. If you leave a hostile creature’sreach during you r move, you provoke an opportunity attack, as explained later in the chapter.

### Flying Movement

Flying creatures enjoy m any benef its of mobility, but the y must also deal with the danger of f all ing. If a flying creature is knocked pr one, has its speed reduced to 0, or is o the r wise deprived of the ability to move, the creature f all s, unless it has the ability to h over or it is being held aloft by magic, such as by the fly spell.

### Creature Size

Each creature take s up a different amount of space. The Size Categories table s how s how much space a creature of a particular size controls in combat. Objects som etim es use the same size categories.

### Size Categories

### Size Categories

Size Space Tiny 2 1/2 by 2 1/2 ft Sm all 5 by 5 ft. Medium 5 by 5 ft. Large 10 by 10 ft. Huge 15 by 15 ft. Gargantuan 20 by 20 ft. or larger

### Space

A creature's space is the are a in feet that it effectively controls in combat, not an expression of its physical dim ensions. A typical M edium creature isn't 5 feet wide, for example, but it does control a space that wide. If aMedium hobgoblin st and s in a 5-foot-wide door way, o the r creatures can’t get through unless the hobgoblin lets the m. A creature’s space also reflects the are a it needs to fight effectively. For that reason, the re’salimit to the number of creatures that can surround an o the r creature in combat. Assum ing Medium combatants, eight creatures can fit in a 5-foot radius around an o the r one. Beca use larger creatures take up more space, fewer ofthe m can surround a creature. If five Large creatures Variant : Play in gonaGr id If you play out a combat using a squ are grid and miniatures or o the r tokens, follow the se rules. Squ are s. Each squ are on the grid represents 5 feet. Speed. Ra the r than moving foot by foot, move squ are by squ are on the grid. This means you use you r speed in 5-foot segments. This is particularly easy if you translate you r speed into squ are s by dividing the speed by 5. For example, a speed of 30 feet translates into a speed of 6 squ are s. If you use a grid of ten, consider writing you r speed in squ are s on you r character sheet. Entering a Squ are. To enter a squ are, you must have at least 1 squ are of movement left, even if the squ are is diagon all y adjacent to the squ are you’re in. (The rule for diagonal movement sacrifices realism for the sake of smooth play. The Dungeon M aster’s Guide provides guidance on using a more realistic approach.) If a squ are costs extra movement, as a squ are of difficult terrain does, you must have enough movement left to pay for entering it. For example, you must have at least 2 squ are s of movement left to enter a squ are of difficult terrain. Corners. Diagonal movement can’t cross the corner of a w all, large tree, or o the r terrain feature that fills its space. Ranges. To determine the range on a grid between two things— whe the r creatures or objects— start counting squ are s from a squ are adjacent to one of the m and stop counting in the space of the o the r one. Count by the shortest r out e. crowd around a Medium or sm all er one, the re’s little room for any one else. In contrast, as m any as twenty Medium creatures can surround a Gargantuan one.

### Squeezingintoa Smaller Space

A creature can squeeze through a space that is large enough for a creature one size sm all er than it. Thus, a Large creature can squeeze through a passage that's only 5 feet wide. W hile squeezing through a space, a creature must spend 1 extra foot for every foot it moves the re, and it has disadvantage on attack rolls and Dexterity saving throws. Attack rolls against the creature have advantage while it’s in the sm all er space. Act io nsin Combat W hen you take you r action on you r turn, you can take one of the actions presented here, an action you gained from you r class or a special feature, or an action that you improvise. M any monsters have action options of the ir own in the ir stat blocks. W hen you describe an action not detailed elsewhere in the rules, the DM tells you whe the r that action is possible and what kind ofroll you need to make, if any, to determine success or failure.

### Attack

The most com m on action to take in combat is the Attack action, whe the r you are swinging a sword, firing an arrow from a bow, or brawling with you r fists. With this action, you make one melee or ranged attack. See the “Making an Attack” section for the rules that g over n attacks. Certain features, such as the Extra Attack feature of the fighter, all ow you to make more than one attack with this action.

### Casta Spell

Spellcasters such as w izards and clerics, as well as m any monsters, have access to spells and can use the m to great effect in combat. Each spell has a casting time, which specifies whe the r the caster must use an action, a reaction, minutes, or even h our s to cast the spell. Casting a spell is, the re for e, not necessarily an action. Most spells do have a casting time of 1 action, so a spellcaster of ten use s his or her action in combat to cast such a spell. See chapter 10 for the rules on spellcasting.

### Dash

W hen you take the Dash action, you gain extra movement for the current turn. The increase equals you r speed, after applying any modifiers. With a speed of 30 feet, for example, you can move up to 60 feet on you r turn if you dash. Any increase or decrease to you r speed changes this additional movement by the same amount. If you r speed of 30 feet is reduced to 15 feet, for instance, you can move up to 30 feet this turn if you dash.

### Dis

e n g a g e If you take the Disengage action, you r movement doesn’t provoke opportunity attacks for the rest of the turn.

### Dodge

W hen you take the Dodge action, you focus entirely on avoiding attacks. Until the start of you r next turn, any attack roll made against you has disadvantage if you can see the attacker, and you make Dexterity saving throws with advantage. You lose this benefit if you are incapacitated (as explained in appendix A) or if you r speed drops to 0.

### Help

You can lend you r aid to an o the r creature in the completion of a task. W hen you take the Help action, the creature you aid gains advantage on the next ability check it make s to per for m the task you are helping with, provided that it make s the check be for e the start of you r next turn. Alternatively, you can aid a friendly creature in attacking a creature with in 5 feet of you. You feint, distract the tar get, or in some o the r way team up to make you r all y’s attack more effective. If you r all y attacks the tar get be for e you r next turn, the first attack roll is made with advantage.

### Hide

W hen you take the Hide action, you make a Dexterity (Stealth) check in an attempt to hide, following the rules in chapter 7 for hiding. If you succeed, you gain certain benef its, as described in the “Un see n Attackers and Tar get s” section later in this chapter.

### Makingan Attack

Im provisinganAction Y our character can do things not c over ed by the actions in this chapter, such as breaking down doors, intimidating enemies, sensing weaknesses in magical defenses, or c all ing for a parley with a foe. The only lim its to the actions you can attempt are you r imagination and you r character’s ability scores. See the descriptions of the ability scores in chapter 7 for inspiration as you improvise. When you describe an action not detailed elsewhere in the rules, the DM tells you whe the r that action is possible and what kind of roll you need to make, if any, to determine success or failure.

### Ready

### Search

W hen you take the Search action, you devote you r attention to finding some thing. Depending on the nature of you r search, the DM might have you make aWisdom (Perception) check or an Intelligence (Investigation) check.

### Usean Object

You norm all y interact with an object while doing som ething else, such as when you draw a sword as part of an attack. W hen an object requires you r action for its use, you take the Use an Object action. This action is also use ful when you want to interact with more than one object on you r turn. W he the r you’re striking with a melee weapon, firing a w eapon at range, or making an attack roll as part of a spell, an attack has a simple structure. Som etim es you want to get the jum p on a foe or wait for a particular circum stance be for e you act. To do so, you can take the Ready action on you r turn so that you can act later in the round using you r reaction. First, you decide what perceivable circum stance will trigger you r reaction. Then, you choose the action you will take in response to that trigger, or you choose to move up to you r speed in response to it. Examples include “If the cultist steps on the trapdoor, I’ll pull the lever that opens it,” and “If the goblin steps next to me, I move a way.” W hen the trigger occurs, you can ei the r take you r reaction right after the trigger finishes or ignore the trigger. Rem em ber that you can take only one reaction per round. W hen you ready a spell, you cast it as normal but hold its energy, which you release with you r reaction when the trigger occurs. To be readied, a spell must have a casting time of 1 action, and holding onto the spell’s magic requires concentration (explained in chapter 10). If you r concentration is broken, the spell dissipates with out taking effect. For example, if you are concentrating on the web spell and ready magic missile, you r web spell ends, and if you take damage be for e you release magic missile with you r reaction, you r concentration might be broken.

### Attack Rolls

W hen you make an attack, you r attack roll determines whe the r the attack h its or m isses. To make an attack roll, roll a d20 and add the appropriate modifiers. If the total ofthe roll plus m odifiers equals or exceeds the tar get’s Arm or Class (AC), the attack h its. The AC of a character is determined at character creation, whereas the AC of a monster is in its stat block.

### Modifierstothe Roll

W hen a character make s an attack roll, the two most com m on modifiers to the roll are an ability modifier and the character’s proficiency bonus. W hen a monster m akes an attack roll, it use s what ever modifier is provided in its stat block. Ability Modifier. The ability modifier use d for a melee weapon attack is Strength, and the ability modifier use d for a ranged weapon attack is Dexterity. W eapons that have the finesse or thrown property break this rule. Som e spells also require an attack roll. The ability m odifier use d for a spell attack depends on the spellcasting ability ofthe spellcaster, as explained in chapter 10. Proficiency Bonus. You add you r proficiency bonus to you r attack roll when you attack using a weapon with which you have proficiency, as well as when you attack with a spell. Rolling 1 o r 2 0 Som etim es fate blesses or curses a combatant, causing the novice to hit and the veteran to miss. If the d20 roll for an attack is a 20, the attack h its regardless ofany modifiers or the tar get’s AC. In addition, the attack is a critical hit, as explained later in this chapter. If the d20 roll for an attack is a 1, the attack m isses regardless of any modifiers or the tar get’s AC.

### Unseen Attackersand Targets

1. Choose a tar get. Pick a tar get with in you r attack’s range: a creature, an object, or a location. 2. Determine modifiers. The DM determines whe the r the tar get has c over and whe the r you have advantage or disadvantage against the tar get. In addition, spells, special abilities, and o the r effects can apply penalties or bon use s to you r attack roll. 3. Resolve the attack. You make the attack roll. On a hit, you roll damage, unless the particular attack has rules that specify o the r wise. S om e attacks ca use special effects in addition to or instead ofdamage. If the re’s ever any question whe the r som ething you’re doing counts as an attack, the rule is simple: if you’re making an attack roll, you’re making an attack. Combatants of ten try to escape the ir foes’ not ice by hiding, casting the invisibility spell, or lurking in darkness. W hen you attack a tar get that you can’t see, you have disadvantage on the attack roll. This is true whe the r you’re guessing the tar get’s location or you’re tar get ing a creature you can hear but not see. If the tar get isn’t in the location you tar get ed, you automatic all ymiss, but the DM typic all y just says that the attack m issed, not whe the r you guessed the tar get’s location correctly. W hen a creature can’t see you, you have advantage on attack rolls against it. If you are hidden—both un see n and unheard—when you make an attack, you give a way you r location when the attack h its or m isses.

### Ranged At

t a c k s W hen you make a ranged attack, you fire a bow or a crossbow, hurl ahand axe, or o the r wise send projectiles to strike a foe at a distance. A monster might shoot spines from its tail. M any spells also involve making a ranged attack.

### Range

You can make ranged attacks only against tar get s with in a specified range. If a ranged attack, such as one made with a spell, has a single range, you can’t attack a tar get beyond this range. S om e ranged attacks, such as those made with a longbow or a shortbow, have two ranges. The sm all er number is the normal range, and the larger num ber is the long range. Y our attack roll has disadvantage when you r tar get is beyond normal range, and you can’t attack a tar get beyond the long range.

### Ranged Attacksin Close Combat

Aiming a ranged attack is more difficult when a foe is next to you. W hen you make a ranged attack with a weapon, a spell, or some o the r means, you have disadvantage on the attack roll if you are with in 5 feet of a hostile creature who can see you and w ho isn’t incapacitated.

### Melee Attacks

Used in h and-to-h and combat, a melee attack all ows you to attack a foe with in you r r each. A melee attack typic all y use sah and held weapon such as a sword, a warhammer, or an axe. A typical monster make s a melee attack when it strikes with its claws, horns, teeth, tentacles, or o the r body part. A few spells also involve making a melee attack. M ost creatures have a 5-foot r each and can thus attack tar get s with in 5 feet of the m when making a m elee attack. Certain creatures (typic all y those larger than Medium) have melee attacks with a greater r each than 5 feet, as not ed in the ir descriptions. W hen you are unarmed, you can fight in melee by making an unarmed strike, as s how n in the weapon table in chapter 5.

### Opportunity Attacks

In a fight, every one is constantly watching for enemies to drop the ir guard. You can r are ly move heedlessly past you r foes with out putting you r self in danger; doing so provokes an opportunity attack. You can make an opportunity attack when a hostile creature that you can see m oves out of you r r each. To make the opportunity attack, you use you r reaction to make one melee attack against the provoking Contests in Combat Battle of ten involves pitting you r prowess against that of you r foe. Such a ch all enge is represented by a contest. This section includes the most common contests that require an action in combat: grappling and shoving a creature. The DM can use the se contests as models for improvising o the r s. creature. The attack interrupts the provoking creature’s movement, occurring right be for e the creature leaves you r r each. You can avoid provoking an opportunity attack by taking the Disengage action. You also don’t provoke an opportunity attack when you teleport or when some one or som ething m oves you with out using you r movement, action, or reaction. For example, you don’t provoke an opportunity attack if an explosion hurls you out of a foe’s r each or if gravity ca use s you to f all past an enemy. Two-WeaponFighting W hen you take the Attack action and attack with a light melee weapon that you’re holding in one h and, you can use a bonus action to attack with a different light melee weapon that you’re holding in the o the rhand. You don’t add you r ability modifier to the damage of the bonus attack, unless that modifier is negative. If ei the r weapon has the thrown property, you can throw the weapon, instead of making a melee attack with it.

### Grappling

W hen you want to grab a creature or wrestle with it, you can use the Attack action to make a special melee attack, a grapple. If you’re able to make multiple attacks with the Attack action, this attack replaces one of the m. The tar get of you r grapple must be no more than one size larger than you, and it must be with in you r r each. Using at least one free h and, you try to seize the tar get by making a grapple check, a Strength (Athletics) check contested by the tar get’s Strength (Athletics) or Dexterity (Acrobatics) check (the tar get chooses the ability to use). If you succeed, you subject the tar get to the grappled condition (see appendix A). The condition specifies the things that end it, and you can release the tar get when ever you like (no action required). Escaping a Grapple. A grappled creature can use its action to escape. To do so, it must succeed on a Strength (Athletics) or Dexterity (Acrobatics) check contested by you r Strength (Athletics) check. Moving a Grappled Creature. W hen you move, you can drag or carry the grappled creature with you, but you r speed is halved, unless the creature is two or more sizes sm all er than you.

### Shovinga Creature

Using the Attack action, you can make a special melee attack to shove a creature, ei the r to knock it pr one or push it a way from you. If you’re able to make multiple attacks with the Attack action, this attack replaces one of the m. The tar get of you r shove must be no more than one size larger than you, and it must be with in you r r each. You make a Strength (Athletics) check contested by the tar get’s Strength (Athletics) or Dexterity (Acrobatics) check (the tar get chooses the ability to use). If you win the contest, you ei the r knock the tar get pr one or push it 5 feet a way from you.

### Cover

W all s, trees, creatures, and o the r obstacles can provide c over during combat, making a tar get more difficult to harm. A tar get can benefit from c over only when an attack or o the r effect originates on the opposite side of the c over. There are three degrees of c over. If a tar get is behind multiple s our ces of c over, only the most protective degree ofc over applies; the degrees are n't added toge the r. For example, if a tar get is behind a creature that give s half c over and a tree trunk that give s three- quarters c over, the tar get has three-quarters c over. A tar get with half c over has a +2 bonus to AC and Dexterity saving throws. A tar get has half c over if an obstacle blocks at least half of its body. The obstacle might be a low w all, a large piece of furniture, a narrow tree trunk, or a creature, whe the r that creature is an enemy or a friend. A tar get with three-quarters c over has a +5 bonus to AC and Dexterity saving throws. A tar get has three- quarters c over if ab out three-quarters of it is c over ed by an obstacle. The obstacle might be a portcullis, an arrow slit, or a thick tree trunk. A tar get with total c over can’t be tar get ed directly by an attack or a spell, although some spells can r each such a tar get by including it in an are a of effect. A tar get has total c over if it is completely concealed by an obstacle. Damage and Heal in g Injury and the risk of death are constant com panions of those who explore the w orlds of D&D. The thrust of a sword, a well-placed arrow, or a blast of flame from a fireb all spell all have the potential to damage, or even kill, the hardiest of creatures.

### Hit Points

Hit points represent a combination of physical and mental durability, the will to live, and luck. Creatures with more hit points are more difficult to kill. Those with fewer hit points are more fragile. A creature’s current hit points (usu all y just c all ed hit points) can be any number from the creature’s hit point maximum down to 0. This number changes frequently as a creature take s damage or receives healing. W henever a creature take s damage, that damage is subtracted from its hit points. The loss of hit points has no effect on a creature’s capabilities until the creature drops to 0 hit points.

### Damage Rolls

Each weapon, spell, and harmful monster ability specifies the damage it deals. You roll the damage die or dice, add any modifiers, and apply the damage to you r tar get. Magic weapons, special abilities, and o the r factors can grant a bonus to damage. W hen attacking with a weapon, you add you r ability modifier—the same modifier use d for the attack roll— to the damage. A spell tells you which dice to roll for damage and whe the r to add any modifiers. If a spell or o the r effect deals damage to more than one tar get at the sam e time, roll the damage once for all of the m. For example, when a wizard casts fireb all or a cleric casts flame strike, the spell’s damage is rolled once for all creatures caught in the blast. CriticalH it s W hen you score a critical hit, you get to roll extra dice for the attack’s damage against the tar get. Roll all of the attack’s damage dice twice and add the m toge the r. Then add any relevant modifiers as normal. To speed up play, you can roll all the damage dice at once. For example, if you score a critical hit with a dagger, roll 2d4 for the damage, ra the r than 1d4, and the n add you r relevant ability modifier. If the attack involves o the r damage dice, such as from the rogue’s Sneak Attack feature, you roll those dice twice as well.

### Damage Types

Different attacks, damaging spells, and o the r harmful effects deal different types of damage. Damage types have no rules of the ir own, but o the r rules, such as damage resistance, rely on the types. The damage types follow, with examples to help a DM assign a damage type to a new effect. Acid. The corrosive spray of a black dragon’s breath and the dissolving enzym es secreted by a black pudding deal acid damage. Bludgeoning. Blunt for ce attacks—hammers, f all ing, constriction, and the like—deal bludgeoning damage. Cold. The infernal chill radiating from an ice devil’s spear and the frigid blast of a white dragon’s breath deal cold damage. Fire. Red dragons brea the fire, and m any spells conjure flames to deal fire damage. Force. Force is pure magical energy foc use d into a damaging for m. Most effects that deal for ce damage are spells, including magic missile and spiritual weapon. Lightning. A lightning bolt spell and a blue dragon’s breath deal lightning damage. Necrotic. Necrotic damage, dealt by certain undead and a spell such as chill touch, with ers matter and even the soul. Piercing. Puncturing and impaling attacks, including spears and m onsters’ bites, deal piercing damage. Poison. Venomous stings and the toxic gas of a green dragon’s breath deal poison damage. Psychic. Mental abilities such as a mind flayer’s psionic blast deal psychic damage. Radiant. Radiant damage, dealt by a cleric’s flame strike spell or an angel’s smiting weapon, sears the flesh like fire and over loads the spirit with power. Slashing. Swords, axes, and m onsters’ claws deal slashing damage. Thunder. A concussive burst of sound, such as the effect ofthe thunderwave spell, deals thunder damage.

### Damage Resistanceand

### Vulnerability

S om e creatures and objects are exceedingly difficult or unusu all y easy to hurt with certain types of damage. If a creature or an object has resistance to a damage type, damage of that type is halved against it. If a creature or an object has vulnerability to a damage type, damage of that type is doubled against it. Resistance and the n vulnerability are applied after all o the r modifiers to damage. For example, a creature has resistance to bludgeoning damage and is hit by an attack that deals 25 bludgeoning damage. The creature is also with in amagical aura that reduces all damage by 5. The 25 damage is first reduced by 5 and the n halved, so the creature take s 10 damage. Multiple instances of resistance or vulnerability that affect the sam e damage type count as only one instance. For example, if a creature has resistance to fire damage as w ell as resistance to all nonm agical damage, the damage of a nonm agical fire is reduced by half against the creature, not reduced by three-quarters.

### Healing

Unless it results in death, damage isn’t permanent. Even death is reversible through powerful magic. Rest can restore a creature's hit points (as explained in chapter 8), and magical m ethods such as a cure wounds spell or a potion of healing can remove damage in an instant. W hen a creature receives healing of any kind, hit points regained are added to its current hit points. A creature’s hit points can’t exceed its hit point maximum, so any hit points regained in excess of this num ber are lost. For example, a druid grants a ranger 8 hit points of healing. If the ranger has 14 current hit points and has a hit point maximum of 20, the ranger regains 6 hit points from the druid, not 8. A creature that has died can’t regain hit points until magic such as the revivify spell has restored it to life. Droppingto 0 HitPoints W hen you drop to 0 hit points, you ei the r die out right or f all unconscious, as explained in the following sections.

### Instant Death

Massive damage can kill you instantly. W hen damage reduces you to 0 hit points and the re is damage remaining, you die if the remaining damage equals or exceeds you r hit point maximum. For example, a cleric with amaximum of 12 hit points currently has 6 hit points. If she take s 18 damage from an attack, she is reduced to 0 hit points, but 12 damage remains. Beca use the remaining damage equals her hit point maximum, the cleric dies. Fa llingUnconscious If damage reduces you to 0 hit points and fails to kill you, you f all unconscious (see appendix A). This unconsciousness ends if you regain any hit points.

### Describingthe Effectsof Damage

Dungeon Masters describe hit point loss in different way s. When you r current hit point total is half or more of you r hit point maximum, you typic all yshow no signs of injury. When you drop below half you r hit point maximum, you s how signs of wear, such as cuts and bruises. An attack that reduces you to 0 hit points strikes you directly, leaving a bleeding injury or o the r trauma, or it simply knocks you unconscious. Death Sa vingThrows W henever you start you r turn with 0 hit points, you must make a special saving throw, c all ed a death saving throw, to determine whe the r you creep closer to death or hang onto life. Unlike o the r saving throws, this one isn’t tied to any ability score. You are in the h and s of fate now, aided only by spells and features that improve you r chances of succeeding on a saving throw. Roll a d20. If the roll is 10 or higher, you succeed. O the rwise, you fail. A success or failure has no effect by its elf. On you r third success, you becom e stable (see below). On you r third failure, you die. The successes and failures don't need to be consecutive; keep track of both until you collect three of a kind. The number of both is reset to zero when you regain any hit points or becom e stable. Rolling 1 or 20. W hen you make a death saving throw and roll a 1 on the d20, it counts as two failures. If you roll a 20 on the d20, you regain 1 hit point. Damage at 0 Hit Points. If you take any damage while you have 0 hit points, you suffer a death saving throw failure. If the damage is from a critical hit, you suffer two failures instead. If the damage equals or exceeds you r hit point maximum, you suffer instant death. St abilizingaCreature The best way to save a creature with 0 hit points is to heal it. If healing is unavailable, the creature can at least be stabilized so that it isn’t killed by a failed death saving throw. You can use you r action to administer first aid to an unconscious creature and attempt to stabilize it, which requires a successful DC 10 W isdom (Medicine) check. A stable creature doesn’t make death saving throws, even though it has 0 hit points, but it does remain unconscious. The creature stops being stable, and must start making death saving throws again, if it take s any damage. A stable creature that isn’t healed regains 1 hit point after 1d4 h our s.

### Monstersand Death

Most DMs have a monster die the instant it drops to 0 hit points, ra the r than having it f all unconscious and make death saving throws. Mighty villains and special nonplayer characters are com m on exceptions; the DM might have the m f all unconscious and follow the sam e rules as player characters.

### Knockinga Creature Out

Som etim es an attacker want s to incapacitate a foe, ra the r than deal a killing blow. W hen an attacker reduces a creature to 0 hit points with a melee attack, the attacker can knock the creature out. The attacker can make this choice the instant the damage is dealt. The creature f all s unconscious and is stable.

### Temporary Hit Points

Som e spells and special abilities confer temporary hit points to a creature. Temporary hit points are n’t actual hit points; the y are a buffer against damage, a pool of hit points that protect you from injury. W hen you have temporary hit points and take damage, the temporary hit points are lost first, and any left over damage carries over to you r normal hit points. For example, if you have 5 temporary hit points and take 7 damage, you lose the temporary hit points and the n take 2 damage. Beca use temporary hit points are separate from you r actual hit points, the y can exceed you r hit point maximum. A character can, the re for e, be at full hit points and receive temporary hit points. Healing can’t restore temporary hit points, and the y can’t be added toge the r. If you have temporary hit points and receive more of the m, you decide whe the r to keep the one s you have or to gain the new one s. For example, if a spell grants you 12 temporary hit points when you already have 10, you can have 12 or 10, not 22. If you have 0 hit points, receiving temporary hit points doesn’t restore you to consciousness or stabilize you. They can still absorb damage directed at you while you’re in that state, but only true healing can save you. Unless a feature that grants you temporary hit points has a duration, the y last until the y’re depleted or you finish a long rest.

### Mounted Combat

A knight charging into battle on a warhorse, a wizard casting spells from the back of a griffon, or a cleric soaring through the sky on a pegasus all enjoy the benef its of speed and mobility that a mount can provide. A will ing creature that is at least one size larger than you and that has an appropriate anatomy can serve as a mount, using the following rules.

### Mountingand Dismounting

Once during you r move, you can mount a creature that is with in 5 feet of you or dismount. Doing so costs an amount of movement equal to half you r speed. For example, if you r speed is 30 feet, you must spend 15 feet of movement to mount a horse. There for e, you can’t mount it if you don’t have 15 feet ofmovement left or if you r speed is 0. If an effect m oves you r mount against its w ill while you’re on it, you must succeed on a DC 10 Dexterity saving throw or f all of f the mount, l and ing pr one in a space with in 5 feet of it. If you’re knocked pr one while mounted, you must make the same saving throw. If you r mount is knocked pr one, you can use you r reaction to dismount it as it f all s and l and on you r feet. O the rwise, you are dismounted and f all pr one in a space with in 5 feet it.

### Controllinga Mount

W hile you're mounted, you have two options. You can ei the r control the mount or all ow it to act independently. Intelligent creatures, such as dragons, act independently. You can control a mount only if it has been trained to accept a rider. Dom esticated horses, donkeys, and similar creatures are assum ed to have such training. The initiative of a controlled mount changes to match you r s when you mount it. It m oves as you direct it, and it has only three action options: Dash, Disengage, and Dodge. A controlled mount can move and act even on the turn that you mount it. An independent mount retains its place in the initiative order. Bearing a rider puts no restrictions on the actions the mount can take, and it m oves and acts as it wishes. It might flee from combat, rush to attack and dev our a badly injured foe, or o the r wise act against you r wishes. In ei the r case, if the mount provokes an opportunity attack while you’re on it, the attacker can tar get you or the mount.

### Underwater Combat

W hen adventurers pursue sahuagin back to the ir undersea homes, fight of f sharks in an ancient shipwreck, or find the mselves in a flooded dungeon room , the y must fight in a ch all enging environment. Underwater the following rules apply. W hen making a melee weapon attack, a creature that doesn’t have a swim m ing speed (ei the r natural or granted by magic) has disadvantage on the attack roll unless the weapon is a dagger, javelin, shortsword, spear, or trident. A ranged weapon attack automatic all ymisses a tar get beyond the w eapon’s normal range. Even against a tar get with in normal range, the attack roll has disadvantage unless the weapon is a crossbow, a net, or a weapon that is thrown like a javelin (including a spear, trident, or dart). Creatures and objects that are fully im m ersed in water have resistance to fire damage.

## 10. Sp Ellcasting

### Spell Level

M AGIC PERMEATES THE WORLDS OF D&D AND most of ten appears in the for m of a spell. This chapter provides the rules for casting spells. Different character classes have distinctive way s of learning and preparing the ir spells, and monsters use spells in unique way s. Regardless of its s our ce, a spell follows the rules here. WhatIsa Spell? A spell is a discrete magical effect, a single shaping of the magical energies that suff use the multiverse into a specific, limited expression. In casting a spell, a character c are fully plucks at the invisible str and s of raw m agic suffusing the world, pins the m in place in a particular pattern, sets the m vibrating in a specific way, and the n releases the m to unleash the desired effect—in most cases, all in the span ofseconds. Spells can be versatile tools, weapons, or protective wards. They can deal damage or undo it, im pose or remove conditions (see appendix A), drain life energy a way, and restore life to the dead. Uncounted thous and s of spells have been created over the c our se of the multiverse’s history, and m any of the m are long for gotten. Som e might yet lie recorded in crumbling spellbooks hidden in ancient ruins or trapped in the minds of dead gods. Or the y might some day be reinvented by a character who has am assed enough power and w isdom to do so. Every spell has a level from 0 to 9. A spell’s level is a general indicator of how powerful it is, with the lowly (but still impressive) magic missile at 1st level and the earth-shaking wish at 9th. Cantrips—simple but powerful spells that characters can cast al most by rote— are level 0. The higher a spell’s level, the higher level a spellcaster must be to use that spell. Spell level and character level don’t correspond directly. Typic all y, a character has to be at least 17th level, not 9th level, to cast a 9th-level spell.

### Knownand Prepared Spells

Be for easpellcaster can useaspell, he or she must have the spell firmly fixed in mind, or must have access to the spell in a magic item. M embers of a few classes, including bards and sorcerers, have a limited list of spells the y know that are al way s fixed in mind. The same thing is true ofm any magic-using monsters. O the r spellcasters, such as clerics and wizards, undergo a process ofpreparing spells. This process varies for different classes, as detailed in the ir descriptions. Casting in Armor Beca use of the mental focus and precise gestures required for spellcasting, you must be proficient with the armor you are wearing to cast a spell. You are o the r wise too distracted and physic all y hampered by you r armor for spellcasting. In every case, the number ofspells a caster can have fixed in mind at any give n time depends on the character’s level.

### Spell Slots

Regardless of how m any spells a caster know s or prep are s, he or she can cast only a limited num ber of spells be for e resting. Manipulating the fabric of magic and channeling its energy into even a simple spell is physic all y and ment all y taxing, and higher-level spells are even more so. Thus, each spellcasting class’s description (except that of the warlock) includes a table s how ing how m any spell slots of each spell level a character can use at each character level. For example, the 3rd-level wizard Umara has f our 1st-level spell slots and two 2nd-level slots. W hen a character casts a spell, he or she expends a slot of that spell’s level or higher, effectively “filling” a slot with the spell. You can think of a spell slot as a groove of a certain size—sm all for a 1st-level slot, larger for a spell of higher level. A 1st-level spell f its into a slot of any size, but a 9th-level spell f its only in a 9th-level slot. Sowhen Umara casts magic missile, a 1st-level spell, she spends one of her f our 1st-level slots and has three remaining. Finishing a long rest restores any expended spell slots (see chapter 8 for the rules on resting). Som e characters and m onsters have special abilities that let the m cast spells with out using spell slots. For example, amonk who follows the Way ofthe F our Elements, a warlock who chooses certain eldritch invocations, and a pit fiend from the Nine Hells can all cast spells in such a way.

### Castinga Spellata Higher Level

W hen a spellcaster casts a spell using a slot that is of a higher level than the spell, the spell assum es the higher level for that casting. For instance, if Umara casts magic missile using one of her 2nd-level slots, that magic missile is 2nd level. Effectively, the spell exp and s to fill the slot it is put into. Som e spells, such as magic missile and cure wounds, have more powerful effects when cast at a higher level, as detailed in a spell’s description.

### Cantrips

A can trip is a spell that can be cast at will, with out using a spell slot and with out being prep are d in advance. Repeated practice has fixed the spell in the caster’s mind and inf use d the caster with the magic needed to produce the effect over and over. A can trip’s spell level is 0.

### Rituals

Certain spells have a special tag: ritual. Such a spell can be cast following the norm al rules for spellcasting, or the spell can be cast as a ritual. The ritual version of a spell take s 10 minutes longer to cast than normal. It also doesn’t expend a spell slot, which m eans the ritual version of a spell can’t be cast at a higher level. To cast a spell as a ritual, a spellcaster must have a feature that grants the ability to do so. The cleric and the druid, for example, have such a feature. The caster must also have the spell prep are d or on his or her list of spells know n, unless the character’s ritual feature specifies o the r wise, as the wizard’s does. Castinga Spell W hen a character casts any spell, the sam e basic rules are followed, regardless of the character’s class or the spell’s effects. Each spell description in chapter 11 begins with a block of in for mation, including the spell’s name, level, school of magic, casting time, range, comp one nts, and duration. The rest of a spell entry describes the spell’s effect.

### Casting Time

Most spells require a single action to cast, but some spells require a bonus action, a reaction, or much more time to cast.

### Bonus Action

A spell cast with a bonus action is especi all y swift. You must use a bonus action on you r turn to cast the spell, provided that you have n’t already take nabonus action this turn. You can’t cast an o the r spell during the same turn, except for a can trip with a casting time of 1 action.

### Reactions

Som e spells can be cast as reactions. These spells take a fraction of a second to bring ab out and are cast in response to some even t. If a spell can be cast as a reaction, the spell description tells you exactly when you can do so. LongerCastingT im e s Certain spells (including spells cast as rituals) require more time to cast: minutes or even h our s. W hen you cast a spell with a casting time longer than a single action or reaction, you must spend you r action each turn casting the spell, and you must maintain you r concentration while you do so (see “Concentration” below). If you r concentration is broken, the spell fails, but you don’t expend a spell slot. If you want to try casting the spell again, you must start over.

### Range

The tar get of a spell must be with in the spell’s range. For a spell like magic missile, the tar get is a creature. For a spell like fireb all, the tar get is the point in space where the b all of fire erupts. M ost spells have ranges expressed in feet. Som e spells can tar get only a creature (including you) that you touch. O the r spells, such as the shield spell, affect only you. These spells have a range of self. Spells that create c one s or lines of effect that originate from you also have a range ofself, indicating that the origin point of the spell’s effect must be you (see “Areas ofEffect” later in the this chapter). Once a spell is cast, its effects are n’t limited by its range, unless the spell’s description says o the r wise.

### Components

A spell’s com p one nts are the physical requirements you must meet in order to cast it. Each spell’s description indicates whe the r it requires verbal (V), som atic (S), or material (M) com p one nts. If you can’t provide one or more of a spell’s com p one nts, you are unable to cast the spell. Verbal (V ) Most spells require the chanting of mystic words. The w ords the mselves are n’t the s our ce ofthe spell’s power; ra the r, the particular combination of sounds, with specific pitch and resonance, sets the threads of magic in motion. Thus, a character who is gagged or in an are a of silence, such as one created by the silence spell, can’t cast a spell with a verbal comp one nt. Somatic (S) Spellcasting gestures might include a for ceful gesticulation or an intricate set of gestures. If a spell requires a som atic comp one nt, the caster must have free use of at least one h and to per for m the se gestures. Material (M ) Casting some spells requires particular objects, specified in p are n the se s in the com p one nt entry. A character can use a comp one nt pouch or a spellcasting focus (found in chapter 5) in place of the com p one nts specified for a spell. But if a cost is indicated for a comp one nt, a character must have that specific com p one nt be for e he or she can cast the spell. If a spell states that a material com p one nt is consum ed by the spell, the caster must provide this com p one nt for each casting of the spell. A spellcaster must have ahand free to access the se com p one nts, but it can be the sam ehand that he or she use s to per for m som atic comp one nts.

### Duration

A spell's duration is the length of time the spell persists. A duration can be expressed in rounds, minutes, h our s, or even years. Som e spells specify that the ir effects last until the spells are dispelled or destroyed.

### Instantaneous

M any spells are instantaneous. The spell harms, heals, creates, or alters a creature or an object in a way that can’t be dispelled, beca use its magic exists only for an instant.

### Concentration

Som e spells require you to maintain concentration in order to keep the ir m agic active. If you lose concentration, such a spell ends. If a spell must be maintained with concentration, that fact appears in its Duration entry, and the spell specifies how long you can concentrate on it. You can end concentration at any time (no action required).

### The Schoolsof Magic

Academies of magic group spells into eight categories c all ed schools of magic. Scholars, particularly wizards, apply the se categories to all spells, believing that all magic functions in essenti all y the same way, whe the r it derives from rigorous study or is bestowed by a deity. The schools of magic help describe spells; the y have no rules of the ir own, although some rules refer to the schools. Abjuration spells are protective in nature, though some of the m have aggressive use s. They create magical barriers, negate harmful effects, harm trespassers, or banish creatures to o the r planes of existence. Conjuration spells involve the transportation of objects and creatures from one location to an o the r. Some spells summon creatures or objects to the caster’s side, whereas o the rsall ow the caster to teleport to an o the r location. Some conjurations create objects or effects out of not hing. Divination spells reveal in for mation, whe the r in the for m of secrets long for gotten, glimpses of the future, the locations of hidden things, the truth behind illusions, or visions of distant people or places. Enchantment spells affect the minds of o the r s, influencing or controlling the ir behavior. Such spells can make enemies see the caster as a friend, for ce creatures to take acour se of action, or even control an o the r creature like a puppet. Evocation spells manipulate magical energy to produce a desired effect. Some c all up blasts of fire or lightning. O the rs channel positive energy to heal wounds. Illusion spells deceive the senses or minds of o the r s. They ca use people to see things that are not the re, to miss things that are the re, to hear phantom noises, or to remember things that never happened. Some illusions create phantom images that any creature can see, but the most insidious illusions plant an image directly in the mind of a creature. Necromancy spells manipulate the energies of life and death. Such spells can grant an extra reserve of life for ce, drain the life energy from an o the r creature, create the undead, or even bring the dead back to life. Creating the undead through the use of necromancy spells such as animate dead is not a good act, and only evil casters use such spells frequently. Transmutation spells change the properties of a creature, object, or environment. They might turn an enemy into a harmless creature, bolster the strength of an all y, make an object move at the caster’s comm and, or enhance a creature’s innate healing abilities to rapidly rec over from injury. Normal activity, such as moving and attacking, doesn’t interfere with concentration. The following factors can break concentration: • Casting an o the r spell that requires concentration. You lose concentration on a spell if you cast an o the r spell that requires concentration. You can’t concen­ trate on two spells at once. • Taking damage. Whenever you take damage while you are concentrating on a spell, you must make a Constitution saving throw to maintain you r concentra­ tion. The DC equals 10 or half the damage you take, which ever number is higher. If you take damage from multiple s our ces, such as an arrow and a dragon’s breath, you make a separate saving throw for each s our ce of damage. • Being incapacitated or killed. You lose concentration on a spell if you are incapacitated or if you die. The DM might also decide that certain environmental phenomena, such as a wave crashing over you while you’re on a storm -tossed ship, require you to succeed on a DC 10 Constitution saving throw to maintain concentration on a spell.

### Targets

A typical spell requires you to pick one or more tar get s to be affected by the spell’s magic. A spell's description tells you whe the r the spell tar get s creatures, objects, or a point of origin for an are a of effect (described below). Unless a spell has a perceptible effect, a creature might not know it w as tar get ed by a spell at all. An effect like crackling lightning is obvious, but a more subtle effect, such as an attempt to read a creature’s thoughts, typic all y goes un not iced, unless a spell says o the r wise. AClear Pa thto the Tar get To tar get some thing, you must have a clear path to it, so it can’t be behind total c over. If you place an are a of effect at a point that you can’t see and an obstruction, such as awall, is between you and that point, the point oforigin com es into being on the near side of that obstruction.

### Targeting Yourself

If a spell tar get sacreature of you r choice, you can choose you r self, unless the creature must be hostile or specific all yacreature o the r than you. If you are in the are a of effect of a spell you cast, you can tar get you r self.

### Areasof Effect

Spells such as burning h and s and c one of cold c over an are a, all owing the m to affect multiple creatures at once. A spell’s description specifies its are a of effect, which typic all y has one of five different shapes: c one, cube, cylinder, line, or sphere. Every are a of effect has a point of origin, a location from which the spell’s energy erupts. The rules for each shape specify how you position its point of origin. Typic all y, a point of origin is a point in space, but some spells have an are awhose origin is a creature or an object. A spell’s effect exp and s in straight lines from the point of origin. If no unblocked straight line extends from the point of origin to a location with in the are a of effect, that location isn’t included in the spell’s are a. To block one of the se imaginary lines, an obstruction must provide total c over, as explained in chapter 9.

### Cone

Acone extends in a direction you choose from its point of origin. Acone’s width at a give n point along its length is equal to that point’s distance from the point of origin. Acone’s are a of effect specifies its maximum length. Acone’s point of origin is not included in the c one’s are a of effect, unless you decide o the r wise.

### Cube

You select a cube’s point of origin, which lies any where on a face of the cubic effect. The cube’s size is expressed as the length of each side. A cube’s point of origin is not included in the cube’s are a of effect, unless you decide o the r wise.

### Cylinder

A cylinder’s point of origin is the center of a circle of a particular radius, as give n in the spell description. The circle must ei the r be on the ground or at the height of the spell effect. The energy in a cylinder exp and s in straight lines from the point of origin to the perimeter of the circle, for ming the base of the cylinder. The spell’s effect the n shoots up from the base or down from the top, to a distance equal to the height of the cylinder. A cylinder’s point of origin is included in the cylinder’s are a of effect. L in e A line extends from its point of origin in a straight path up to its length and c over s an are a defined by its width. A line’s point of origin is not included in the line’s are a of effect, unless you decide o the r wise.

### Sphere

You select a sphere’s point of origin, and the sphere extends out ward from that point. The sphere’s size is expressed as a radius in feet that extends from the point. A sphere’s point of origin is included in the sphere’s are a of effect.

### Saving Throws

M any spells specify that a tar get can make a saving throw to avoid some or all of a spell’s effects. The spell specifies the ability that the tar get use s for the save and what happens on a success or failure. The DC to resist one of you r spells equals 8 + you r spellcasting ability modifier + you r proficiency bonus + any special modifiers.

### Attack Rolls

Som e spells require the caster to make an attack roll to determine whe the r the spell effect h its the intended tar get. Y our attack bonus with a spell attack equals you r spellcasting ability m odifier + you r proficiency bonus. Most spells that require attack rolls involve ranged attacks. Rem ember that you have disadvantage on a ranged attack roll if you are with in 5 feet of a hostile creature that can see you and that isn’t incapacitated (see chapter 9).

### Combining Magical Effects

The effects of different spells add toge the r while the durations of those spells over lap. The effects of the same spell cast multiple time s don't combine, how ever. Instead, the m ost potent effect—such as the highest bonus—from those castings applies while the ir durations over lap. For example, if two clerics cast bless on the same tar get, that character gains the spell’s benefit only once; he or she doesn’t get to roll two bonus dice. TheWeaveofMag ic The worlds with in the D&D multiverse are magical places. All existence is suff use d with magical power, and potential energy lies untapped in every rock, stream, and living creature, and even in the air its elf. Raw magic is the stuff of creation, the mute and mindless will of existence, permeating every bit of matter and present in every manifestation of energy through out the multiverse. Mortals can’t directly shape this raw magic. Instead, the y make use of a fabric of magic, a kind of interface between the will of a spellcaster and the stuff of raw magic. The spellcasters of the Forgotten Realms c all it the Weave and recognize its essence as the goddess Mystra, but casters have varied way s of naming and visualizing this interface. By any name, with out the Weave, raw magic is locked a way and inaccessible;the most powerful archmage can't light acand le with magic in an are a where the Weave has been torn. But surrounded by the Weave, a spellcaster can shape lightning to blast foes, transport hundreds of miles in the blink of an eye, or even reverse death its elf. All magic depends on the Weave, though different kinds of magic access it in a variety of way s. The spells of wizards, warlocks, sorcerers, and bards are comm only c all ed ar can e magic. These spells rely on an underst and ing— learned or intuitive— of the workings of the Weave. The caster plucks directly at the str and s of the Weave to create the desired effect. Eldritch knights and ar can e tricksters also use ar can e magic. The spells of clerics, druids, paladins, and rangers are c all ed divine magic. These spellcasters’ access to the Weave is mediated by divine power— gods, the divine for ces of nature, or the sacred weight of a paladin’s oath. Whenever a magic effect is created, the threads of the Weave intertwine, twist, and fold to make the effect possible. When characters use divination spells such as detect magic or identify, the y glimpse the Weave. A spell such as dispel magic smooths the Weave. Spells such as antimagic field rearrange the Weave so that magic flows around, ra the r than through, the are a affected by the spell. And in places where the Weave is damaged or torn, magic works in unpredictable way s— or not at all.

### Wish

9th-level conjuration Casting Time: 1 action Range: Self Comp one nts: V Duration: Instantaneous Wish is the mightiest spell a mortal creature can cast. By simply speaking aloud, you can alter the very foundations of reality in accord with you r desires. The basic use of this spell is to duplicate any o the r spell of 8th level or lower. You don’t need to meet any requirements in that spell, including costly comp one nts. The spell simply take s effect. Alternatively, you can create one of the following effects of you r choice: • You create one object of up to 25,000 gp in value that isn’tam agic item. The object can be no more than 300 feet in any dimension, and it appears in an unoc­ cupied space you can see on the ground. • You all ow up to twenty creatures that you can see to regain all hit points, and you end all effects on the m described in the greater restoration spell. • You grant up to ten creatures that you can see resis­ tance to a damage type you choose. • You grant up to ten creatures you can see immunity to a single spell or o the r magical effect for 8 h our s. For instance, you could make you r self and all you r com ­ panions immune to a lich’s life drain attack. • You undo a single recent even t by for cing a reroll of any roll made with in the last round (including you r last turn). Reality reshapes its elf to accom m odate the new result. For example, a wish spell could undo an opp one nt’s successful save, a foe’s critical hit, or a friend’s failed save. You can for ce the reroll to be made with advantage or disadvantage, and you can choose whe the r to use the reroll or the original roll. You might be able to achieve som ething beyond the scope ofthe above examples. State you r wish to the DM as precisely as possible. The DM has great latitude in ruling what occurs in such an instance; the greater the wish, the greater the likelihood that som ething goes wrong. This spell might simply fail, the effect you desire might only be partly achieved, or you might suffer some un for e see n consequence as a result of how you worded the wish. For example, wishing that a villain w ere dead might propel you for ward in time to a period when that villain is no longer alive, effectively removing you from the game. Similarly, wishing for a legendary magic item or artifact might instantly transport you to the presence of the item’s current owner. The stress of casting this spell to produce any effect o the r than duplicating an o the r spell w eakens you. After enduring that stress, each time you cast a spell until you finish a long rest, you take 1d10 necrotic damage per level of that spell. This damage can’t be reduced or pr even ted in any way. In addition, you r Strength drops to 3, if it isn’t 3 or lower already, for 2d4 day s. For each of those day s that you spend resting and doing not hing more than light activity, you r remaining rec over y time decreases by 2 day s. Fin all y, the re is a 33 percent chance that you are unable to cast wish ever again if you suffer this stress.

Exhaustion is measured in six levels. An effect can give a creature one or more levels of exhaustion, as specified in the effect’s description. Level Effect 1 Disadvantage on ability checks 2 Speed halved 3 Disadvantage on attack rolls and saving throws 4 Hit point maximum halved 5 Speed reduced to 0 6 Death If an already exhausted creature suffers an o the r effect that ca use s exhaustion, its current level of exhaustion increases by the amount specified in the effect’s description. A creature suffers the effect of its current level of exhaustion as well as all lower levels. For example, a creature suffering level 2 exhaustion has its speed halved and has disadvantage on ability checks. An effect that removes exhaustion reduces its level as specified in the effect’s description, with all exhaustion effects ending if a creature’s exhaustion level is reduced below 1. Finishing a long rest reduces a creature's exhaustion level by 1, provided that the creature has also ingested some food and drink. ■f Pois one d • A pois one d creature has disadvantage on attack rolls and ability checks.

AppendixB: Godsof the Multiverse RELIGION IS AN IMPORTANT PART OF LIFE IN the worlds of the D&D multiverse. When gods walk the world, clerics channel divine power, evil cults per for m dark sacrifices in subterranean lairs, and shining paladins st and like beacons against the darkness, it’s hard to be ambivalent ab out the deities and deny the ir existence. M any people in the worlds of D&D worship different gods at different time s and circum stances. People in the Forgotten Realms, for example, might pray to Sune for luck in love, make an of fering to W aukeen be for e heading to the market, and pray to appease Talos when a severe storm blows in—all in the sam e day. Many people have a favorite am ong the gods, one w hose ideals and t each ings the y make the ir own. And a few people dedicate the mselves entirely to a single god, usu all y serving as a priest or champion of that god’s ideals. Y our DM determines which gods, if any, are worshiped in his or her campaign. From among the gods available, you can choose a single deity for you r character to serve, worship, or pay lip service to. Or you can pick a few that you r character prays to most of ten. Or just make a mental not e of the gods w ho are revered in you r DM ’s campaign so you can invoke the ir names when appropriate. If you’re playing a cleric or a character with the Acolyte back ground, decide which god you r deity serves or served, and consider the deity’s suggested dom ains when selecting you r character’s domain. D&DPan the ons Each world in the D&D multiverse has its own pan the ons of deities, ranging in size from the teeming pan the ons of the Forgotten Realm s and Greyhawk to the more foc use d religions of Eberron and Dragonlance. M any of the nonhuman races worship the sam e gods on different w orlds—Moradin, for example, is revered by dwarves of the Forgotten Realms, Greyhawk, and m any o the r worlds.

### The Forgotten Realms

D ozens of deities are revered, worshiped, and fe are d through out the world of the Forgotten Realms. At least thirty deities are widely know n across the Realms, and m any more are worshiped loc all y, by individual tribes, sm all cults, or certain sects of larger religious temples. TheL ife and DeathDomains M any deities in this section suggest the Life domain, particularly if the y are closely associated with healing, protection, childbirth, nurturing, or fertility. As described in the chapter 3, though, the Life domain is incredibly broad, and a cleric of any non-evil deity can choose it. A number of o the r deities, most ly evil one s, suggest the Death domain, which is detailed in the Dungeon Master’s Guide. Most clerics who choose this domain are evil NPCs, but if you want to worship a god of death, consult you r Dungeon Master.

### Greyhawk

The gods ofGreyhawk com e from at least f our different pan the ons, representing the faiths of the various ethnic groups that populated the continent of Oerik over the ages. As a result, the re’sagreat deal of over lap in the ir portfolios: Pelor is the Flan god of the sun and Pholtus is the Oeridian sun god, for example.

### Dragonlance

The gods of the world of Krynn are three families: s even gods of good headed by Paladine and Mishakal, s even of neutrality headed by Gilean, and s even of evil headed by Takhisis and Sargonnas. These deities have been c all ed by m any different names and held in varying levels of esteem by different peoples and cultures through the w orld’s history, but the y are the only gods of this w orld— the ir place fixed in the stars as constellations.

### Eberron

The world of Eberron has m any different religions, but the most important revolves around a pan the on c all ed the S over eign Host and the ir malign shadow, the Dark Six. The gods of the S over eign Host are thought to have dom inion over every aspect of existence, and to speak with a unified voice. But the Dark Six are the primitive, bloody, and cruel gods w ho of fer a dissenting voice. Eberron’sothe r religions are very different from the traditional D&D pan the ons. The mono the istic Church of the Silver Flame is devoted to fighting against evil in the world, but plagued by corruption in its own ranks. The philosophy of the Blood of Vol t each es that divinity lies with in all mortal beings and reveres the undead who have secured that immortality. Various mad cults are devoted to the dem ons and horrors impris one d in Eberron's Underdark (c all ed Khyber, the Dragon Below). The followers of the Path of Light believe that the w orld is heading toward a glorious future where the shadows that cloud this world will be trans for med into light. And two related nations of elves revere the ir ancestral spir its: the Undying C our t, preserved as spir its or even undead for ms, and the glorified Spir its of the Past, the great heroes of ancient wars. NonhumanDeit ie s Certain gods closely associated with nonhuman races are revered on m any different worlds, though not al way s in the same way. The nonhuman races of the Forgotten Realm s and Greyhawk sh are the se deities. Nonhuman races of ten have who le pan the ons of the ir own. Besides Moradin, for example, the dwarf gods include M oradin’s wife, Berronar Truesilver, and a number of o the r gods thought to be the ir children and gr and children: Abbathor, Clangeddin Silverbeard, Dugm are n Brightmantle, Dumathoin, Gorm Gulthyn, Haela Brightaxe, M arthammor Duin, Sharindlar, Thard Harr, and Vergadain. Individual clans and kingdom s of dwarves might revere some, all, or n one of the se deities, and some have o the r gods un know n (or know n by o the r names) to out siders.

They include deities that are most appropriate for use in a D&D game, divorced from the ir historical context in the real world and united into pan the ons that serve the needs of the game. TheCelt ic Pa n the on It’s said that som ething wild lurks in the heart of every soul, a space that thrills to the sound of geese c all ing at night, to the whispering wind through the pines, to the unexpected red of mistletoe on an oak—and it is in this space that the Celtic gods d well. They sprang from the brook and stream, the ir might heightened by the strength of the oak and the beauty of the woodl and s and open moor. W hen the first for ester d are d put a name to the face see n in the bole of a tree or the voice babbling in a brook, the se gods for ced the mselves into being. The Celtic gods are as of ten served by druids as by clerics, for the y are closely aligned with the for ces of nature that druids revere. TheGreek Pa n the on The gods of Olympus make the mselves know n with the gentle lap of waves against the shores and the crash of the thunder am ong the cloud-enshrouded peaks. The thick boar-infested w oods and the sere, olive-c over ed hillsides hold evidence of the ir passing. Every aspect of nature echoes with the ir presence, and the y’ve made a place for the mselves inside the human heart, too. TheEgyptian Pa n the on These gods are a you ng dynasty of an ancient divine family, heirs to the rulership of the cosm os and the maintenance of the divine principle of Ma’at—the fundamental order of truth, just ice, law, and order that puts gods, mortal pharaohs, and ordinary men and w om en in the ir logical and rightful place in the universe. The Egyptian pan the on is unusual in having three gods with the Death dom ain ofdifferent alignments. Anubis is the lawful neutral god of the after life, who Fa ntasy - H is tor ic alPa n the ons judges the souls of the dead. Set is a chaotic evil god of murder, perhaps best know n for killing his br o the r Osiris. And Nephthys is a chaotic good goddess of m our ning. Thus, although m ost clerics of the Death domain (found in the Dungeon Master's Guide) are villainous characters, clerics w ho serve Anubis or Nephthys need not be. TheNorse Pa n the on W here the l and plummets from the snowy hills into the icy fjords below, where the longboats draw up on to the b each, where the glaciers flow for ward and retreat with every f all and spring—this is the l and of the Vikings, the hom e of the Norse pan the on. It’sabrutal clime, and one that c all s for brutal living. The w arriors of the l and have had to adapt to the harsh conditions in order to survive, but the y have n’t been too twisted by the needs of the ir environment. Given the necessity of raiding for food and wealth, it’s surprising the mortals turned out as well as the y did. Their powers reflect the need the se warriors had for strong leadership and decisive action. Thus, the y see the ir deities in every bend of a river, hear the m in the crash of the thunder and the boom ing of the glaciers, and smell the m in the sm oke of a burning longho use. The Norse pan the on includes two main families, the Aesir (deities of war and destiny) and the Vanir (gods of fertility and prosperity). Once enemies, the se two families are now closely all ied against the ir com m on enemies, the giants (including the gods Surtur and Thrym). Like the gods of Greyhawk, gods in different families som etim es have over lap in the ir spheres of influence: Frey (of the Vanir) and Odur (of the Aesir) are both associated with the sun, for example.

It encom passes every world where Dungeon Masters run the ir adventures, all with in the relatively mundane realm of the Material Plane. Beyond that plane are domains of raw elemental matter and energy, realm s of pure thought and ethos, the hom es of dem ons and angels, and the dom inions of the gods. M any spells and magic items can draw energy from the se planes, sum m on the creatures that d well the re, com m unicate with the ir denizens, and all ow adventurers to travel the re. As you r character achieves greater power and higher levels, you might under take a quest to rescue a friend from the horrific depths of the Abyss, or find you r self hoisting a tankard with the friendly giants of Ysgard. You might w alk on streets made of solid fire or test you r mettle on a battlefield where the f all en are resurrected with each dawn. TheMater ia lPlane The Material Plane is the nexus where the philosophical and elemental for ces that define the o the r planes collide in the jum bled existence of mortal life and mundane matter. All the worlds of D&D exist with in the Material Plane, making it the starting point for most campaigns and adventures. The rest of the multiverse is defined in relation to the Material Plane. The worlds of the Material Plane are infinitely diverse, for the y reflect the creative imagination of the DMs who set the ir gam es the re, as well as the players w hose heroes adventure the re. They include magic-was ted desert planets and isl and-dotted water worlds, worlds where magic com bines with advanced technology and o the rstrapped in an endless St one Age, worlds where the gods walk and places the y have ab and one d. The best-know n worlds in the multiverse are the one s that have been published as of ficial campaign settings for the D&D game over the years—Greyhawk, Blackmoor, Dragonlance, the Forgotten Realms, Mystara, Birthright, Dark Sun, and Eberron, among o the r s. Each of the se worlds boasts its own cast of heroic adventurers and schem ing villains, its own ancient ruins and for gotten artifacts, its own dungeons and its own dragons. But if you r campaign take s place on one of the se worlds, it belongs to you r DM—you might imagine it as one of thous and s of par all el versions of the world, which might diverge wildly from the published version.

### Material Echoes

The Material Plane is a richly magical place, and its magical nature is reflected in the two planes that sh are its central place in the multiverse. The Feywild and the Shadowfell are par all el dim ensions occupying the same cosm ological space, so the y are of ten c all ed echo planes or mirror planes to the Material Plane. The w orlds and l and scapes of the se planes mirror the natural world of the Material Plane but reflect those features into different for m s—more marvelous and magical in the Feywild, distorted and colorless in the Shadowfell. W here a vol can o st and s in the Material Plane, a mountain topped with skyscraper-sized crystals that glow with internal fire towers in the Feywild, and a jagged rock out cropping resembling a skull marks the spot on the Shadowfell. The Feywild, also c all ed the Plane of Faerie, is aland of soft lights and wonder, a country of little people with great desires, a place of music and death. It is a realm of eternal twilight, with slow lanterns bobbing in the gentle breeze and huge fireflies buzzing through groves and fields. The sky is alight with the faded colors of the setting, or perhaps rising, sun. But, in fact, the sun never truly sets or rises; it remains stationary, dusky and low in the sky. A way from the settled are as ruled by the Seelie C our t, the l and is a tangle of sharp-too the d brambles and syrupy fens—perfect territory for the Un see lie to hunt the ir prey. Fey creatures, such as those brought to the world by conjure woodl and beings and similar spells, d well in the Feywild. The Shadowfell, also c all ed the Plane ofShadow, is a darkly lighted dimension, a world of black and white where color has been l each ed from everything. It is a place of toxic darkness that hates the light, where the sky is a black vault with nei the r sun nor stars.

### Positiveand Negative Planes

Like a dome above the o the r planes, the Positive Plane is the s our ce of radiant energy and the raw life for ce that suff use s all living beings, from the puny to the sublime. Its dark reflection is the Negative Plane, the s our ce of necrotic energy that destroys the living and animates the undead. Beyond the Mater ia l Beyond the Material Plane, the various planes of existence are realm s of myth and mystery. They’re not simply o the r worlds, but different qualities of being, for med and g over ned by spiritual and elemental principles abstracted from the ordinary world.

### Planar Travel

W hen adventurers travel into o the r planes of existence, the y are undertaking a legendary j our ney across the thresholds of existence to a mythic destination where the y strive to complete the ir quest. Such ajour ney is the stuff of legend. Braving the realm s of the dead, see king out the celestial servants of a deity, or bargaining with an efreeti in its hom e city will be the subject of song and story for years to com e. Travel to the planes beyond the Material Plane can be accom plished in two way s: by casting a spell or by using a planar portal. Spells. A number of spells all ow direct or indirect access to o the r planes of existence. Plane shift and gate can transport adventurers directly to any o the r plane of existence, with different degrees of precision. E the realness all ows adventurers to enter the E the real Plane and travel from the re to any of the planes it touches—the Shadowfell, the Feywild, or the Elemental Planes. And the astral projection spell lets adventurers project the mselves into the Astral Plane and travel to the Outer Planes. Portals. A portal is a general term for a stationary interplanar connection that links a specific location on one plane to a specific location on an o the r. Som e portals are like door way s, a clear window, or a fog- shrouded passage, and simply stepping through it effects the interplanar travel. O the rs are locations— circles of st and ing st one s, soaring towers, sailing ships, or even who le towns—that exist in multiple planes at once or flicker from one plane to an o the r in turn. Som e are vortices, typic all y joining an Elemental Plane with a very similar location on the Material Plane, such as the heart of a vol can o (leading to the Plane ofFire) or the depths of the ocean (to the Plane of Water).

### Transitive Planes

The E the real Plane and the Astral Plane are c all ed the Transitive Planes. They are most ly featureless realms that serve primarily as way s to travel from one plane to an o the r. Spells such as e the realness and astral projection all ow characters to enter the se planes and traverse the m to r each the planes beyond. The E the real Plane is a misty, fog-bound dimension that is som etim es described as a great ocean. Its shores, c all ed the Border E the real, over lap the Material Plane and the Inner Planes, so that every location on those planes has a corresponding location on the E the real Plane. Certain creatures can see into the Border E the real, and the see invisibility and true see ing spell grant that ability. Som e magical effects also extend from the Material Plane into the Border E the real, particularly effects that use for ce energy such as for cecage and w all offor ce. The depths of the plane, the Deep E the real, are a region of swirling mists and colorful fogs. The Astral Plane is the realm ofthought and dream, where visitors travel as disem bodied souls to r each the planes of the divine and dem onic. It is a great, silvery sea, the sam e above and below, with swirling w isps of white and gray streaking am ong motes of light resem bling distant stars. Erratic w hirlpools of color flicker in midair like spinning coins. Occasional b its of solid matter can be found here, but most of the Astral Plane is an endless, open domain.

### Inner Planes

The Inner Planes surround and enfold the Material Plane and its echoes, providing the raw elemental substance from which all the w orlds were made. The f our Elemental Planes—Air, Earth, Fire, and Water— for maring around the Material Plane, suspended with in the churning Elemental Chaos. At the ir inner most edges, where the y are closest to the Material Plane (in a conceptual if not a literal geographical sense), the f our Elemental Planes resemble a world in the Material Plane. The f our elements mingle toge the r as the y do in the Material Plane, for ming l and, sea, and sky. Far the r from the Material Plane, though, the Elemental Planes are both alien and hostile. Here, the elements exist in the ir purest for m—great expanses of solid earth, blazing fire, crystal-clear water, and unsullied air. These regions are little-know n, so when discussing the Plane of Fire, for example, a speaker usu all ymeans just the border region. At the far the st extents of the Inner Planes, the pure elements dissolve and bleed toge the r into an unending tumult of clashing energies and colliding substance, the Elemental Chaos.

### Outer Planes

If the Inner Planes are the raw matter and energy that make s up the multiverse, the Outer Planes are the direction, thought and purpose for such construction. Accordingly, m any sages refer to the Outer Planes as divine planes, spiritual planes, or godly planes, for the Outer Planes are best know n as the hom es of deities. W hen discussing any thing to do with deities, the language use d must be highly metaphorical. Their actual hom es are not liter all y “places” at all, but exemplify the idea that the Outer Planes are realm s of thought and spirit. As with the Elemental Planes, one can imagine the perceptible part of the Outer Planes as a sort of border region, while extensive spiritual regions lie beyond ordinary sensory experience. Even in those perceptible regions, appearances can be deceptive. Initi all y, m any of the Outer Planes appear hospitable and familiar to natives of the Material Plane. But the l and scape can change at the whim s of the powerful for ces that live on the Outer Planes. The desires of the mighty for ces that d well on the se planes can re make the m completely, effectively erasing and rebuilding existence its elf to better fulfill the ir own needs. Distance is a virtu all ymeaningless concept on the Outer Planes. The perceptible regions of the planes of ten see m quite sm all, but the y can also stretch on to what see mslike infinity. It might be possible to take a guided t our of the Nine Hells, from the first layer to the ninth, in a single day—if the powers of the Hells desire it. Or it could take weeks for travelers to make a grueling trek across a single layer. The most well-know n Outer Planes are a group of sixteen planes that correspond to the eight alignments (excluding neutrality) and the shades of distinction between the m.

### Outer Planes

Outer Plane Alignment Mount Celestia, the S even Heavens of LG Bytopia, the Twin Paradises of NG, LG Elysium, the Blessed Fields of NG The Beastl and s, the Wilderness of NG, CG Arborea, the Olympian Glades of CG Ysgard, the Heroic Domains of CN, CG Limbo, the Ever-Changing Chaos of CN P and emonium, the Windswept Depths of CN, CE The Abyss, the Infinite Layers of CE Carceri, the Tarterian Depths of NE, CE Hades, the Gray Waste of NE Gehenna, the Bleak Eternity of NE, LE The Nine Hells (of Baator) LE Acheron, the Infinite Battlefield of LN, LE Mechanus, the Clockwork Nirvana of LN Arcadia, the Peaceable Kingdoms of LN, LG The planes with some element of good in the ir nature are c all ed the Upper Planes. Celestial creatures such as angels and pegasi d well in the Upper Planes. Planes with some element of evil are the Lower Planes. Fiends such as dem ons, devils, and yugoloths d well in the Lower Planes. A plane’s alignment is its essence, and a character w hose alignment doesn’t match the plane’s experiences a profound sense of dissonance the re. W hen a good creature vis its Elysium, for example, it feels in tune with the plane, but an evil creature feels out oftune and more than a little uncom for table.

### Other Planes

Existing some how between or beyond the know n planes of existence are a variety of o the r realms.

### Sigilandthe Outlands

The Outl and s is the plane between the Outer Planes, a plane of neutrality, but not the neutrality of not hingness. Instead it incorporates a little of everything, keeping it all in a paradoxical balance—simultaneously concordant and in opposition. It is a broad region of varied terrain, with open prairies, towering mountains, and twisting, sh all ow rivers, strongly resembling an ordinary world of the Material Plane. The Outl and s is circular, like a great w heel—in fact, those w ho envision the Outer Planes as a wheel point to the Outl and s as proof, c all ing it amicrocosm of the planes. That argument might be circular, how ever, for it is possible that the arrangement of the Outl and s inspired the idea of the Great W heel in the first place. Around the out side edge of the circle, even ly spaced, are the gate-towns: sixteen settlements, each built around a portal leading to one ofthe Outer Planes. Each town sh are smany of the characteristics of the plane where its gate leads. At the center of the Outl and s, like the axle of the planar wheel, the Spire shoots im possibly high into the sky. Above this thin peak floats the ring-shaped city of Sigil, the City of Doors. This bustling planar m etropolis holds countless portals to o the r planes and worlds. Sigil is a trader’s city. G oods, merch and ise, and in for mation com e to it from across the planes. There is a brisk trade in in for mation ab out the planes, in particular in the com m and words or items required for the operation of particular portals. These portal keys are highly sought after, and m any travelers with in the city are look ing for a particular portal or a portal key to all ow the m to continue on the ir way.

### Demiplanes

Demiplanes are sm all extradimensional spaces with the ir own unique rules. They are pieces of reality that don’t see m to fit any where else. Demiplanes com e into being by a variety ofmeans. Som e are created by spells, such as demiplane, or generated at the desire of a powerful deity or o the r for ce. They may exist natur all y, as a fold ofexisting reality that has been pinched of f from the rest of the multiverse, or as a baby universe growing in power. A give n demiplane can be entered through a single point where it touches an o the r plane. Theoretic all y, a plane shift spell can also carry travelers to a demiplane, but the proper frequency required for the tuning for k is extremely hard to acquire. The gate spell is more reliable, assum ing the caster know s of the demiplane. The Fa rRealm The Far Realm is beyond the know n multiverse. In fact, it might be an entirely separate multiverse with its own physical and magical laws. W here stray energies from the Far Realm leak onto an o the r plane, life and matter are warped and twisted into alien shapes that defy ordinary geometry and biology. The entities that abide in the Far Realm are too alien for a normal mind to accept with out damage. Titanic creatures swim through not hingness, preoccupied with m adness. Unspeakable things whisper awful truths to those w ho d are listen. For mortals, know ledge of the Far Realm is a triumph of mind over the rude boundaries of matter, space, and even tu all y sanity. There are no know n portals to the Far Realm, or at least n one that are still viable. Ancient elves once pierced the boundary of eons with a vast portal to the Far Realm with in a mountain c all ed Firestorm Peak, but the ir civilization im ploded in bloody terror and the portal’s location—even its home world—is long- for gotten. O the r portals might still exist, marked by the alien for ces leaking through to corrupt the Material Plane around the m.
