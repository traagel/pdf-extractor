Preface

ONCE UPON A TIME, LONG, LONG AGO, IN A

realm called the Midwestern United

States—specifically the states ofMinne­

sota and W isconsin—a group of friends

gathered together to forever alter the

history ofgaming.

It wasn’t the ir intent to do so.

They were

tired of merely reading tales about worlds of magic,

monsters, and adventure.

They wanted to play in those

worlds, rather than observe the m.

That the y went on

to invent Dun geo n s & Dra gon s , and the reby ignite a

revolution in gaming that continues to this day, speaks

to two things.

First, it speaks to the ir ingenuity and genius in fig­

uring out that gam es w ere the perfect way to explore

w orlds that could not otherwise exist.

Alm ost every

m odern game, whether played on a digital device or

a tabletop, ow es som e debt to D&D.

Second, it is a testament to the inherent appeal of the

game the y created.

Dun geo n s & Dra gon s sparked a

thriving global phenomenon.

It is the first roleplaying

game, and it remains one of the best of its breed.

To play D&D, and to play it well, you don’t need to

read all the rules, m em orize every detail of the game,

or master the fine art ofrolling funny looking dice.

None of those things have any bearing on what’s best

about the game.

W hat you need are two things, the first being friends

with whom you can share the game.

Playing games with

you r friends is a lot of fun, but D&D does som ething

m ore than entertain.

Playing D&D is an exercise in collaborative creation.

You and you r friends create epic stories filled with ten­

sion and memorable drama.

You create silly in-jokes

that make you laugh years later.

The dice will be cruel

to you, but you will soldier on.

Your collective creativ­

ity will build stories that you will tell again and again,

ranging from the utterly absurd to the stuff of legend.

If you don’t have friends interested in playing, don’t

worry.

There’saspecial alchemy that takes place

around a D&D table that nothing else can match.

Play

the game with som eone enough, and the two of you

are likely to end up friends.

It’sacool side effect ofthe

game.

Your next gaming group is as close as the nearest

game store, online forum, or gaming convention.

The second thing you need is a lively imagination

or, m ore importantly, the will ingness to use what ever

imagination you have.

You don’t need to be a master

storyteller or a brilliant artist.

You just need to aspire to

create, to have the courage of som eone who is will ing to

build som ething and share it with others.

Luckily, just as D&D can strengthen you r friendships,

it can help build in you the confidence to create and

share.

D&D is a game that teaches you to look for the

clever solution, share the sudden idea that can overcom e

a problem, and push you rself to imagine what could be,

rather than simply accept what is.

The first characters and adventures you create will

probably be a collection of cliches.

That’s true of every­

one, from the greatest Dungeon Masters in history on

down.

Accept this reality and move on to create the

second character or adventure, which will be better,

and the n the third, w hich will be better still.

Repeat that

over the course of time, and soon you’ll be able to create

anything, from a character’s background story to an epic

world of fantasy adventure.

Once you have that skill, it’s you rs forever.

Countless

writers, artists, and other creators can trace the ir begin­

nings to a few pages ofD&D notes, a handful of dice,

and a kitchen table.

Above all else, D&D is you rs.

The friendships you

make around the table will be unique to you.

The adven­

tures you embark on, the characters you create, the

m em ories you make—the se will be you rs.

D&D is you r

personal corner of the universe, a place where you have

free reign to do as you wish.

Goforth now.

Read the rules of the game and the

story of its worlds, but always remember that you are

the one who brings the m to life.

They are nothing

with out the spark of life that you give the m.

In tro duc t io n

The Dun geo n s & Dra gon sro le p la y in g

game is about storytelling in w orlds of

sw ords and sorcery.

It shares elements

with childhood games of make-believe.

Like

those games, D&D is driven by imagina­

tion.

It’s about picturing the towering castle

beneath the stormy night sky and imagining

how a fantasy adventurer might react to the challenges

that scene presents.

Dungeon Master (DM): After passing through the

craggy peaks, the road takes a sudden turn to the east

and Castle Ravenloft towers before you.

Crumbling

towers of stone keep a silent watch over the approach.

They look like abandoned guardhouses.

Beyond the se,

a wide chasm gapes, disappearing into the deep

fog below.

A lowered drawbridge spans the chasm,

leading to an arched entrance to the castle courtyard.

The chains of the drawbridge creak in the wind, the ir

rust-eaten iron straining with the weight.

From atop

the high strong walls, stone gargoyles stare at you

from hollow sockets and grin hideously.

A rotting

wooden portcullis, green with growth, hangs in the

entry tunnel.

Beyond this, the main doors of Castle

Ravenloft stand open, a rich warm light spilling into

the courtyard.

Phillip (playing Gareth): I want to look at the

gargoyles.

I have a feeling the y’re not just statues.

Amy (playing Riva): The drawbridge looks precarious?

I want to see how sturdy it is.

Do I think we can cross

it, or is it going to collapse under our weight?

Unlike a game of make-believe, D&D gives structure

to the stories, a way of determining the consequences

of the adventurers’ action.

Players roll dice to resolve

whether the ir attacks hit or m iss or whether the ir adven­

turers can scale a cliff, roll away from the strike of a

m agical lightning bolt, or pull off som e other dangerous

task.

Anything is possible, but the dice make som e out­

com es m ore probable than others.

Dungeon Master (DM): OK, one at a time.

Phillip,

you’re looking at the gargoyles?

Phillip: Yeah.

Is the re any hint the y might be

creatures and not decorations?

DM: Make an Intelligence check.

Phillip: Does my Investigation skill apply?

DM: Sure!

Phillip (rolling a d20): Ugh.

Seven.

DM: They look like decorations to you.

And Amy,

Riva is checking out the drawbridge?

In the Dun geo n s & Dra gon s game, each player

creates an adventurer (also called a character) and

teams up with other adventurers (played by friends).

W orking together, the group might explore a dark dun­

geon, a ruined city, a haunted castle, a lost temple deep

in a jungle, or a lava-filled cavern beneath a mysterious

mountain.

The adventurers can solve puzzles, talk with

other characters, battle fantastic monsters, and discover

fabulous magic items and other treasure.

One player, however, takes on the role of the Dungeon

Master (DM), the gam e’s lead storyteller and referee.

The DM creates adventures for the characters, who nav­

igate its hazards and decide which paths to explore.

The

DM might describe the entrance to Castle Ravenloft,

and the players decide what the y want the ir adventurers

to do.

Will the y walk across the dangerously weathered

drawbridge?

Tie the mselves together with rope to mini­

m ize the chance that som eone will fall if the drawbridge

gives way?

Or cast a spell to carry the m over the chasm?

Then the DM determines the results of the adventur­

ers’ actions and narrates what the y experience.

Because

the DM can improvise to react to anything the players

attempt, D&D is infinitely flexible, and each adventure

can be exciting and unexpected.

The game has no real end; when one story or quest

wraps up, another one can begin, creating an ongoing

story called a campaign.

Many people who play the

game keep the ir cam paigns going for months or years,

meeting with the ir friends every week or so to pick

up the story where the y left off.

The adventurers grow

in might as the campaign continues.

Each monster

defeated, each adventure completed, and each treasure

recovered not only adds to the continuing story, but also

earns the adventurers new capabilities.

This increase

in power is reflected by an adventurer’s level.

There’s no winning and losing in the Dun geo n s &

Dra gon s game—at least, not the way those terms are

usually understood.

Together, the DMand the players

create an exciting story of bold adventurers who confront

deadly perils.

Som etim es an adventurer might com e to

a grisly end, torn apart by ferocious monsters or done in

by a nefarious villain.

Even so, the other adventurers can

search for powerful magic to revive the ir fallen comrade,

or the player might choose to create a new character to

carry on.

The group might fail to complete an adventure

successfully, but if everyone had a good time and created

a memorable story, the y all win.

Wor ld s of Adv ent ure

The many worlds of the Dun geo n s & Dra gon s game

are places ofmagic and monsters, of brave warriors and

spectacular adventures.

They begin with a foundation

of medieval fantasy and the n add the creatures, places,

and magic that make the se worlds unique.

The worlds of the Dun geo n s & Dra gon s game exist

with in a vast cosm os called the multiverse, connected

in strange and mysterious ways to one another and to

other planes of existence, such as the Elemental Plane

of Fire and the Infinite Depths of the Abyss.

Within

this multiverse are an endless variety of worlds.

Many

of the m have been published as official settings for the

D&D game.

The legends of the Forgotten Realms, Drag-

onlance, Greyhawk, Dark Sun, Mystara, and Eberron

settings are woven together in the fabric of the multi-

verse.

Alongside the se worlds are hundreds of thousands

more, created by generations of D&D players for the ir

own games.

And amid all the richness of the multiverse,

you might create a world of you r own.

All the se worlds share characteristics, but each world

is set apart by its own history and cultures, distinctive

monsters and races, fantastic geography, ancient dun­

geons, and schem ing villains.

Som e races have unusual

traits in different worlds.

The halflings of the Dark Sun

setting, for example, are jungle-dwelling cannibals,

and the elves are desert nomads.

Som e worlds feature

races unknown in other settings, such as Eberron’s war-

forged, soldiers created and im bued with life to fight in

the Last War.

Som e worlds are dominated by one great

story, like the War of the Lance that plays a central role

in the Dragonlance setting.

But the y’re all D&D worlds,

and you can use the rules in this book to create a char­

acter and play in any one of the m.

Your DM might set the campaign on one of the se

worlds or on one that he or she created.

Because the re

is so much diversity am ong the worlds of D&D, you

should check with you r DM about any house rules that

will affect you r play of the game.

Ultimately, the Dun­

geon Master is the authority on the campaign and its

setting, even if the setting is a published world.

Usin gTh is Boo k

The Player’s Handbook is divided into three parts.

Part 1 is about creating a character, providing the

rules and guidance you need to make the character

you’ll play in the game.

It includes information on the

various races, classes, backgrounds, equipment, and

other customization options that you can choose from.

Many of the rules in part 1 rely on material in parts 2

and 3.

If you com e across a game concept in part 1 that

you don’t understand, consult the book’s index.

Part 2 details the rules of how to play the game,

beyond the basics described in this introduction.

That

part covers the kinds of die rolls you make to determine

success or failure at the tasks you r character attempts,

and describes the three broad categories ofactivity in

the game: exploration, interaction, and combat.

Part 3 is all about magic.

It covers the nature of magic

in the worlds of D&D, the rules for spellcasting, and the

huge variety ofspells available to magic-using charac­

ters (and monsters) in the game.

How toPl a y

The play of the Dun geo n s & Dra gon s game unfolds

according to this basic pattern.

1.

The DM describes the environment.

The DM

tells the players where the ir adventurers are and what’s

around the m, presenting the basic scope of options that

present the mselves (how many doors lead out of a room,

what’s on a table, w ho’s in the tavern, and so on).

2.

The players describe what the y want to do.

S om e­

times one player speaks for the whole party, saying,

“W e’ll take the east door,” for example.

Other times,

different adventurers do different things: one adventurer

might search a treasure chest while a second exam ines

an esoteric sym bol engraved on a wall and a third keeps

watch for monsters.

The players don’t need to take

turns, but the DM listens to every player and decides

how to resolve those actions.

Som etim es, resolving a task is easy.

If an adventurer

wants to walk across a room and open a door, the DM

might just say that the door opens and describe what

lies beyond.

But the door might be locked, the floor

might hide a deadly trap, or som e other circum stance

might make it challenging for an adventurer to complete

a task.

In those cases, the DM decides what happens,

often relying on the roll of a die to determine the results

of an action.

3.

The DM narrates the results of the adventurers’

actions.

Describing the results often leads to another

decision point, which brings the flow of the game right

back to step 1.

This pattern holds whether the adventurers are cau­

tiously exploring a ruin, talking to a devious prince, or

locked in mortal combat against a mighty dragon.

In

certain situations, particularly combat, the action is

m ore structured and the players (and DM) do take turns

choosing and resolving actions.

But m ost of the time,

play is fluid and flexible, adapting to the circum stances

of the adventure.

Often the action of an adventure takes place in the

imagination of the players and DM, relying on the DM ’s

verbal descriptions to set the scene.

Som e DMs like to

use music, art, or recorded sound effects to help set the

m ood, and many players and DMs alike adopt different

voices for the various adventurers, monsters, and other

characters the y play in the game.

Som etim es, a DM

might lay out a map and use tokens or miniature figures

to represent each creature involved in a scene to help

the players keep track of where everyone is.

### Game Dice

The game uses polyhedral dice with different numbers

of sides.

You can find dice like the se in game stores and

in many bookstores.

In the se rules, the different dice are referred to by the

letter d followed by the number of sides: d4, d6, d8, d 10,

d 12, and d20.

For instance, a d6 is a six-sided die (the

typical cube that many gam es use).

Percentile dice, or d 100, work a little differently.

You

generate a number between 1 and 100 by rolling two

different ten-sided dice num bered from 0 to 9.

One die

(designated before you roll) gives the tens digit, and

the other gives the ones digit.

If you roll a 7 and a 1, for

example, the number rolled is 71.

Two Os represent 100.

Som e ten-sided dice are numbered in tens (00, 10, 20,

and so on), making it easier to distinguish the tens digit

from the ones digit.

In this case, a roll of 70 and 1 is 71,

and 00 and 0 is 100.

W hen you need to roll dice, the rules tell you how

many dice to roll ofa certain type, as well as what m od­

ifiers to add.

For example, “3d8 + 5 ” means you roll

three eight-sided dice, add the m together, and add 5

to the total.

The sam ednotation appears in the expressions “1d3”

and “1d2.” To simulate the roll of 1d3, roll a d6 and

divide the num ber rolled by 2 (round up).

To simulate

the roll of 1d2, roll any die and assign a 1 or 2 to the roll

depending on whether it w as odd or even. (Alternatively,

if the number rolled is m ore than half the number of

sides on the die, it’s a 2.)

The D 2 0

D oes an adventurer’s sword swing hurt a dragon or just

bounce off its iron-hard scales?

Will the ogre believe an

outrageous bluff?

Can a character swim across a raging

river?

Can a character avoid the main blast of a fireball,

or does he or she take full damage from the blaze?

In

cases w here the outcom e of an action is uncertain,

the Dun geo n s & Dra gon s game relies on rolls ofa

20-sided die, a d20, to determine success or failure.

Every character and monster in the game has capa­

bilities defined by six ability scores.

The abilities are

Strength, Dexterity, Constitution, Intelligence, W isdom,

and Charisma, and the y typically range from 3 to 18

for m ost adventurers. (Monsters might have scores as

low as 1 or as high as 30.) These ability scores, and the

ability modifiers derived from the m, are the basis for

almost every d20 roll that a player m akes on a charac­

ter’s or monster’s behalf.

Ability checks, attack rolls, and saving throws are the

three main kinds of d20 rolls, forming the core of the

rules of the game.

All three follow the se simple steps.

1.

Roll the die and add a modifier.

Roll a d20 and

add the relevant modifier.

This is typically the m od­

ifier derived from one of the six ability scores, and it

som etim es includes a proficiency bonus to reflect a char­

acter’s particular skill. (See chapter 1 for details on each

ability and how to determine an ability’s modifier.)

2.

Apply circumstantial bonuses and penalties.

A

class feature, a spell, a particular circum stance, or som e

other effect might give a bonus or penalty to the check.

3.

Compare the total to a target number.

If the total

equals or exceeds the target number, the ability check,

attack roll, or saving throw is a success.

Otherwise, it’s

a failure.

The DM is usually the one w ho determines

target numbers and tells players whether the ir ability

checks, attack rolls, and saving throws succeed or fail.

The target number for an ability check or a saving

throw is called a Difficulty Class (DC).

The target

number for an attack roll is called an Armor Class (AC).

This simple rule governs the resolution of m ost tasks

in D&D play.

Chapter 7 provides m ore detailed rules for

using the d20 in the game.

### Advantageand Disadvantage

Som etim es an ability check, attack roll, or saving throw

is modified by special situations called advantage and

disadvantage.

Advantage reflects the positive circum ­

stances surrounding a d20 roll, while disadvantage

reflects the opposite.

W hen you have either advantage or

disadvantage, you roll a second d20 w hen you make the

roll.

Use the higher of the two rolls if you have advan­

tage, and use the lower roll if you have disadvantage.

For example, if you have disadvantage and roll a 17 and

a 5, you use the 5.

If you instead have advantage and roll

those numbers, you use the 17.

More detailed rules for advantage and disadvantage

are presented in chapter 7.

### Specific Beats General

This book contains rules, especially in parts 2 and 3,

that govern how the game plays.

That said, many racial

traits, class features, spells, magic items, monster abili­

ties, and other game elements break the general rules in

som e way, creating an exception to how the rest ofthe

game works.

Rem em ber this: If a specific rule contra­

dicts a general rule, the specific rule wins.

Exceptions to the rules are often minor.

For instance,

many adventurers don’t have proficiency with longbows,

but every w ood elf does because of a racial trait.

That

trait creates aminor exception in the game.

Other

examples of rule-breaking are m ore conspicuous.

For

instance, an adventurer can’t normally pass through

walls, but som e spells make that possible.

Magic

accounts for m ost ofthe major exceptions to the rules.

### Round Down

There’s one m ore general rule you need to know at the

outset.

W henever you divide a number in the game,

round down if you end up with a fraction, even if the

fraction is one-half or greater.

### Adventures

The Dun geo n s & Dra gon s game consists of a group

of characters embarking on an adventure that the Dun­

geon Master presents to the m.

Each character brings

particular capabilities to the adventure in the form of

ability scores and skills, class features, racial traits,

equipment, and magic items.

Every character is dif­

ferent, with various strengths and w eaknesses, so the

best party of adventurers is one in which the characters

complem ent each other and cover the w eaknesses of

the ir com panions.

The adventurers must cooperate to

successfully complete the adventure.

The adventure is the heart of the game, a story with

a beginning, a middle, and an end.

An adventure might

be created by the Dungeon Master or purchased off the

shelf, tweaked and modified to suit the DM ’s needs and

desires.

In either case, an adventure features a fantastic

setting, whether it’s an underground dungeon, a crum ­

bling castle, a stretch of wilderness, or a bustling city.

It features a rich cast ofcharacters: the adventurers

created and played by the other players at the table,

as well as nonplayer characters (NPCs).

Those char­

acters might be patrons, allies, enemies, hirelings, or

just background extras in an adventure.

Often, one of

the NPCs is a villain w hose agenda drives much of an

adventure’s action.

Over the course of the ir adventures, the characters

are confronted by a variety of creatures, objects, and

situations that the y must deal with in som e way.

S om e­

times the adventurers and other creatures do the ir

best to kill or capture each other in combat.

At other

times, the adventurers talk to another creature (or even

a magical object) with a goal in mind.

And often, the

adventurers spend time trying to solve a puzzle, bypass

an obstacle, find som ething hidden, or unravel the cur­

rent situation.

Meanwhile, the adventurers explore the

world, making decisions about which way to travel and

what the y’ll try to do next.

Adventures vary in length and complexity.

A short

adventure might present only a few challenges, and

it might take no m ore than a single game session to

complete.

A long adventure can involve hundreds of

combats, interactions, and other challenges, and take

dozens ofsessions to play through, stretching over

weeks or months of real time.

Usually, the end of an

adventure is marked by the adventurers heading back to

civilization to rest and enjoy the spoils of the ir labors.

But that’s not the end of the story.

You can think of

an adventure as a single episode of a TV series, made

up of multiple exciting scenes.

A campaign is the whole

series—a string ofadventures joined together, with a

consistent group of adventurers following the narrative

from start to finish.

### The Three Pillarsof Adventure

Adventurers can try to do anything the ir players can

imagine, but it can be helpful to talk about the ir activ­

ities in three broad categories: exploration, social

interaction, and combat.

Exploration includes both the adventurers’ movement

through the world and the ir interaction with objects and

situations that require the ir attention.

Exploration is the

give-and-take of the players describing what the y want

the ir characters to do, and the Dungeon Master telling

the players what happens as a result.

On a large scale,

that might involve the characters spending a day cross­

ing a rolling plain or an hour making the ir way through

caverns underground.

On the sm allest scale, it could

mean one character pulling a lever in a dungeon room to

see what happens.

Social interaction features the adventurers talking to

som eone (or som ething) else.

It might mean demanding

that a captured scout reveal the secret entrance to the

goblin lair, getting information from a rescued prisoner,

pleading for mercy from an orc chieftain, or persuading

a talkative magic m irror to show a distant location to

the adventurers.

The rules in chapters 7 and 8 support exploration and

social interaction, as do many class features in chapter 3

and personality traits in chapter 4.

Combat, the focus of chapter 9, involves characters

and other creatures swinging weapons, casting spells,

maneuvering for position, and so on—all in an effort

to defeat the ir opponents, whether that means killing

every enemy, taking captives, or forcing a rout.

Combat

is the most structured element ofa D&D session, with

creatures taking turns to make sure that everyone gets

a chance to act.

Even in the context of a pitched battle,

the re’s still plenty of opportunity for adventurers to

attempt wacky stunts like surfing down a flight of stairs

on a shield, to examine the environment (perhaps by

pulling a mysterious lever), and to interact with other

creatures, including allies, enem ies, and neutral parties.

### The Wondersof Magic

Few D&D adventures end with out som ething magical

happening.

W hether helpful or harmful, magic appears

frequently in the life of an adventurer, and it is the focus

of chapters 10 and 11.

In the worlds of Dun geo n s & Dra gon s , practitioners

of magic are rare, set apart from the m asses ofpeople

by the ir extraordinary talent.

Com m on folk might see

evidence of magic on a regular basis, but it’s usually

m inor—a fantastic monster, a visibly answered prayer,

a wizard walking through the streets with an animated

shield guardian as a bodyguard.

For adventurers, though, magic is key to the ir sur­

vival.

Without the healing magic of clerics and paladins,

adventurers would quickly succum b to the ir wounds.

Without the uplifting magical support of bards and

clerics, warriors might be overwhelmed by powerful

foes.

Without the sheer magical power and versatility

of wizards and druids, every threat w ould be mag­

nified tenfold.

Magic is also a favored tool of villains.

Many adven­

tures are driven by the machinations of spellcasters

w ho are hellbent on using magic for som e ill end.

A cult

leader seeks to awaken a god w ho slum bers beneath

the sea, a hag kidnaps you ths to magically drain the m

oftheir vigor, a mad wizard labors to invest an army of

automatons with a facsimile of life, a dragon begins a

mystical ritual to rise up as a god of destruction—the se

are just a few of the magical threats that adventurers

might face.

With magic oftheir own, in the form of

spells and magic items, the adventurers might prevail!

## 1. St Ep B Y S Te P Characters

### Building Bruenor

OUR FIRST STEP IN PLAYING AN ADVENTURER IN THE

Dun geo n s & Dra gon s game is to imagine

and create a character of you r own.

Your

character is a combination of game statistics,

roleplaying hooks, and you r imagination.

You

choose a race (such as human or halfling) and

a class (such as fighter or wizard).

You also

invent the personality, appearance, and backstory of

you r character.

Once completed, you r character serves

as you r representative in the game, you r avatar in the

Dun geo n s & Dra gon s world.

Before you dive into step 1 below, think about the

kind ofadventurer you want to play.

You might be a

courageous fighter, a skulking rogue, a fervent cleric, or

a flamboyant wizard.

Or you might be m ore interested

in an unconventional character, such as a brawny rogue

who likes hand-to-hand combat, or a sharpshooter who

picks off enem ies from afar.

Doyou like fantasy fiction

featuring dwarves or elves?

Try building a character of

one of those races.

Doyou want you r character to be the

toughest adventurer at the table?

Consider a class like

barbarian or paladin.

If you don’t know where else to

begin, take a look at the illustrations in this book to see

what catches you r interest.

Once you have a character in mind, follow the se steps

in order, making decisions that reflect the character you

want.

Your conception of you r character might evolve

with each choice you make.

W hat’s important is that you

com e to the table with a character you’re excited to play.

Throughout this chapter, weuse the term character

sheet to mean what ever you use to track you r character,

whether it’saform al character sheet (like the one at the

end of this book), som e form of digital record, or a piece

of notebook paper.

An official D&D character sheet is a

fine place to start until you know what information you

need and how you use it during the game.

Each step ofcharacter creation includes an example of

that step, with a player named Bob building his dwarf

character, Bruenor.

1.

### Choosea Race

Every character belongs to a race, one of the many

intelligent humanoid species in the D&D world.

The

most com m on player character races are dwarves, elves,

halflings, and humans.

Som e races also have subraces,

such as mountain dwarf or w ood elf.

Chapter 2 provides

m ore information about the se races, as well as the less

widespread races of dragonborn, gnom es, half-elves,

half-orcs, and tieflings.

The race you choose contributes to you r character’s

identity in an important way, by establishing a general

appearance and the natural talents gained from culture

and ancestry.

Your character’s race grants particular

racial traits, such as special senses, proficiency with

certain w eapons or tools, proficiency in one or more

skills, or the ability to use minor spells.

These traits

som etim es dovetail with the capabilities of certain

classes (see step 2).

For example, the racial traits of

lightfoot halflings make the m exceptional rogues, and

high elves tend to be powerful wizards.

Som etim es

playing against type can be fun, too.

Half-orc paladins

and mountain dwarf wizards, for example, can be

unusual but memorable characters.

Your race also increases one or m ore of you r ability

scores, which you determine in step 3.

Note the se

increases and remember to apply the m later.

Record the traits granted by you r race on you r

character sheet.

Be sure to note you r starting

languages and you r base speed as well.

Bui ldi ngB rue nor , St e p 1

Bob is sitting down to create his character.

He decides

that a gruff mountain dwarf fits the character he wants

to play.

He notes all the racial traits of dwarves on his

character sheet, including his speed of 25 feet and the

languages he knows: Com m on and Dwarvish.

2.

### Choosea Class

Every adventurer is amem ber of a class.

Class broadly

describes a character’s vocation, what special talents he

or she possesses, and the tactics he or she is most likely

to employ when exploring a dungeon, fighting monsters,

or engaging in a tense negotiation.

The character

classes are described in chapter 3.

Your character receives a number of benefits from

you r choice of class.

Many of the se benefits are class

features—capabilities (including spellcasting) that set

you r character apart from m em bers of other classes.

You also gain a number of proficiencies: armor,

weapons, skills, saving throws, and som etim es tools.

Your proficiencies define many ofthe things you r

character can do particularly well, from using certain

w eapons to telling a convincing lie.

On you r character sheet, record all the features that

you r class gives you at 1st level.

### Level

Typically, a character starts at 1st level and advances

in level by adventuring and gaining experience points

(XP).

A 1st-level character is inexperienced in the

adventuring world, although he or she might have been

a soldier or a pirate and done dangerous things before.

Starting off at 1st level marks you r character’s entry

into the adventuring life.

If you’re already familiar

with the game, or if you are joining an existing D&D

campaign, you r DM might decide to have you begin at a

higher level, on the assumption that you r character has

already survived a few harrowing adventures.

### Quick Build

Each class description in chapter 3 includes a section

offering suggestions to quickly build a character of that

class, including how to assign you r highest ability scores,

a background suitable to the class, and starting spells.

PART 1 S TE P-B Y -STE P CHARACTERS

Record you r level on you r character sheet.

If you’re

starting at a higher level, record the additional elements

you r class gives you for you r levels past 1st.

A lso record

you r experience points.

A 1st-level character has 0

XPA higher-level character typically begins with the

minim um amount of XPrequired to reach that level

(see “Beyond 1st Level” later in this chapter).

Hit Poi nts and Hit D ic e

Your character’s hit points define how tough you r

character is in combat and other dangerous situations.

Your hit points are determined by you r Hit Dice (short

for Hit Point Dice).

At 1st level, you r character has 1 Hit Die, and the

die type is determined by you r class.

You start with hit

points equal to the highest roll of that die, as indicated in

you r class description. (You also add you r Constitution

modifier, which you’ll determine in step 3.) This is also

you r hit point maximum.

R ecord you r character’s hit points on you r character

sheet.

Also record the type ofHit Die you r character

uses and the number of Hit D ice you have.

After you

rest, you can spend Hit D ice to regain hit points (see

“Resting” in chapter 8).

### Proficiency Bonus

The table that appears in you r class description shows

you r proficiency bonus, which is +2 for a 1st-level

character.

Your proficiency bonus applies to many of the

numbers you’ll be recording on you r character sheet:

• Attack rolls using w eapons you’re proficient with

• Attack rolls with spells you cast

• Ability checks using skills you’re proficient in

• Ability checks using tools you’re proficient with

• Saving throws you’re proficient in

• Saving throw DCs for spells you cast (explained in

each spellcasting class)

Your class determines you r w eapon proficiencies,

you r saving throw proficiencies, and som e of you r skill

and tool proficiencies. (Skills are described in chapter 7,

tools in chapter 5.) Your background gives you additional

skill and tool proficiencies, and som e races give

you m ore proficiencies.

Be sure to note all ofthese

proficiencies, as well as you r proficiency bonus, on you r

character sheet.

Your proficiency bonus can’t be added to a single die

roll or other num ber m ore than once.

Occasionally, you r

proficiency bonus might be modified (doubled or halved,

for example) before you apply it.

If a circum stance

suggests that you r proficiency bonus applies m ore than

once to the sam e roll or that it should be multiplied

m ore than once, you nevertheless add it only once,

multiply it only once, and halve it only once.

Bui ldi ngB rue nor , St e p 2

Bob im agines Bruenor charging into battle with an axe,

one horn on his helmet broken off.

He makes Bruenor a

fighter and notes the fighter’s proficiencies and 1st-level

class features on his character sheet.

As a 1st-level fighter, Bruenor has 1 Hit Die—a d 10—

and starts with hit points equal to 10 + his Constitution

modifier.

Bob notes this, and will record the final

number after he determines Bruenor’s Constitution

score (see step 3).

Bob also notes the proficiency bonus

for a 1st-level character, which is +2.

3 .

### Determine Ability Scores

Much of what you r character does in the game depends

on his or her six abilities: Strength, Dexterity,

Constitution, Intelligence, Wisdom, and Charisma.

Each ability has a score, which is a num ber you record

on you r character sheet.

The six abilities and the ir use in the game are

described in chapter 7.

The Ability S core Sum m ary

table provides a quick reference for what qualities

are m easured by each ability, what races increases

which abilities, and what classes consider each ability

particularly important.

You generate you r character's six ability scores

randomly.

Roll four 6-sided dice and record the total of

the highest three dice on a piece of scratch paper.

Do

this five m ore times, so that you have six numbers.

If

you want to save time or don’t like the idea of randomly

determining ability scores, you can use the following

scores instead: 15, 14, 13, 12, 10, 8.

Now take you r six num bers and write each number

beside one ofyour character’s six abilities to assign

scores to Strength, Dexterity, Constitution, Intelligence,

W isdom , and Charisma.

Afterward, make any changes

to you r ability scores as a result of you r race choice.

After assigning you r ability scores, determine

you r ability modifiers using the Ability Scores and

M odifiers table.

To determine an ability modifier with out

consulting the table, subtract 10 from the ability score

and the n divide the result by 2 (round down).

Write the

modifier next to each of you r scores.

Bui ldi ngB rue nor , St e p 3

Bob decides to use the standard set of scores (15, 14,

13, 12, 10, 8) for Bruenor’s abilities.

Since he’safighter,

he puts his highest score, 15, in Strength.

His next-

highest, 14, goes in Constitution.

Bruenor might be a

brash fighter, but Bob decides he wants the dwarf to

be older, wiser, and a good leader, so he puts decent

scores in W isdom and Charisma.

After applying his

racial benefits (increasing Bruenor’s Constitution by

2 and his Strength by 2), Bruenor’s ability scores and

modifiers look like this: Strength 17 (+3), Dexterity 10

(+0), Constitution 16 (+3), Intelligence 8 (-1), W isdom 13

(+1), Charisma 12 (+1).

Bob fills in Bruenor's final hit points: 10 + his

Constitution m odifier of +3, for a total of 13 hit points.

Var ian t : Cus tom izi ngA bil ity Sco res

At you r Dungeon Master’s option, you can use this

variant for determining you r ability scores.

The method

described here allows you to build a character with a set

of ability scores you choose individually.

You have 27 points to spend on you r ability scores.

The cost of each score is shown on the Ability Score

Point Cost table.

For example, a score of 14 costs 7

points.

Using this method, 15 is the highest ability score

you can end up with, before applying racial increases.

You can’t have a score lower than 8.

This method of determining ability scores enables

you to create a set ofthree high numbers and three low

ones (15, 15, 15, 8, 8, 8), a set ofnumbers that are above

### Describe Your Character

Once you know the basic game aspects of you r

character, it’s time to flesh him or her out as a person.

Your character needs a name.

Spend a few minutes

thinking about what he or she looks like and how he or

she behaves in general terms.

Using the information in chapter 4, you can flesh out

you r character’s physical appearance and personality

traits.

Choose you r character’s alignment (the moral

com pass that guides his or her decisions) and ideals.

Chapter 4 also helps you identify the things you r

character holds m ost dear, called bonds, and the flaws

that could one day undermine him or her.

Your character’s background describes where he or

she cam e from, his or her original occupation, and the

character’s place in the D&D world.

Your DM might

offer additional backgrounds beyond the ones included

in chapter 4, and might be will ing to w ork with you to

craft a background that’sam ore precise fit for you r

character concept.

A background gives you r character a background

feature (a general benefit) and proficiency in two skills,

and it might also give you additional languages or

proficiency with certain kinds of tools.

R ecord this

information, along with the personality information

you develop, on you r character sheet.

You rCh ara cte r ’sAb ili tie s

Take you r character’s ability scores and race into

account as you flesh out his or her appearance

and personality.

A very strong character with low

Intelligence might think and behave very differently

from a very smart character with low Strength.

For example, high Strength usually corresponds

with a burly or athletic body, while a character with

low Strength might be scrawny or plump.

A character with high Dexterity is probably lithe and

slim, while a character with low Dexterity might be

either gangly and awkward or heavy and thick-fingered.

A character with high Constitution usually looks

healthy, with bright eyes and abundant energy.

A

character with low Constitution might be sickly or frail.

A character with high Intelligence might be highly

inquisitive and studious, while a character with low

Intelligence might speak simply or easily forget details.

A character with high W isdom has good judgment,

empathy, and a general awareness of what’s going on.

A character with low W isdom might be absent-minded,

foolhardy, or oblivious.

A character with high Charisma exudes confidence,

which is usually mixed with a graceful or intimidating

presence.

A character with a low Charisma might com e

across as abrasive, inarticulate, or timid.

Bui ldi ngB rue nor , St e p 4

B ob fills in som e of Bruenor’s basic details: his name,

his sex (male), his height and weight, and his alignment

(lawful good).

His high Strength and Constitution

suggest a healthy, athletic body, and his low Intelligence

suggests a degree of forgetfulness.

Bob decides that Bruenor com es from a noble line,

but his clan was expelled from its homeland when

Bruenor was very you ng.

He grew up working as a smith

in the remote villages of Icewind Dale.

But Bruenor

has a heroic destiny—to reclaim his homeland—so

Bob chooses the folk hero background for his dwarf.

He notes the proficiencies and special feature this

background gives him.

Bob has a pretty clear picture of Bruenor’s personality

in mind, so he skips the personality traits suggested in

the folk hero background, noting instead that Bruenor is

a caring, sensitive dwarf who genuinely loves his friends

and allies, but he hides this soft heart behind a gruff,

snarling demeanor.

He chooses the ideal of fairness

from the list in his background, noting that Bruenor

believes that no one is above the law.

Given his history, Bruenor’s bond is obvious: he

aspires to som eday reclaim Mithral Hall, his homeland,

from the shadow dragon that drove the dwarves out.

His flaw is tied to his caring, sensitive nature—he has a

soft spot for orphans and wayward souls, leading him to

show m ercy even when it might not be warranted.

5 .

### Choose Equipment

Your class and background determine you r character's

starting equipment, including weapons, armor, and

other adventuring gear.

R ecord this equipment on you r

character sheet.

All such items are detailed in chapter 5.

Instead of taking the gear given to you by you r class

and background, you can purchase you r starting

equipment.

You have a num ber of gold pieces (gp)

to spend based on you r class, as shown in chapter 5.

Extensive lists of equipment, with prices, also appear in

that chapter.

If you wish, you can also have one trinket

at no cost (see the trinket table at the end ofchapter 5).

Your Strength score limits the amount ofgear you can

carry.

Try not to purchase equipment with a total weight

(in pounds) exceeding you r Strength score times 15.

Chapter 7 has m ore information on carrying capacity.

### Armor Class

Your Armor Class (AC) represents how well you r

character avoids being wounded in battle.

Things that

contribute to you r AC include the armor you wear, the

shield you carry, and you r Dexterity modifier.

Not all

characters w ear armor or carry shields, however.

Without armor or a shield, you r character’s AC equals

10 + his or her Dexterity modifier.

If you r character

wears armor, carries a shield, or both, calculate you r

AC using the rules in chapter 5.

R ecord you r AC on

you r character sheet.

Your character needs to be proficient with armor and

shields to w ear and use the m effectively, and you r armor

and shield proficiencies are determined by you r class.

There are drawbacks to wearing armor or carrying a

shield if you lack the required proficiency, as explained

in chapter 5.

Som e spells and class features give you a different

way to calculate you r AC.

If you have multiple features

that give you different ways to calculate you r AC, you

choose which one to use.

### Weapons

For each weapon you r character wields, calculate the

modifier you use when you attack with the w eapon and

the damage you deal when you hit.

W hen you make an attack with a weapon, you roll

a d20 and add you r proficiency bonus (but only if you

are proficient with the weapon) and the appropriate

ability modifier.

• For attacks with melee weapons, use you r Strength

m odifier for attack and damage rolls.

A weapon that

Dexterity modifier instead.

• For attacks with ranged weapons, use you r Dexterity

modifier for attack and damage rolls.

Aweapon that

has the thrown property, such as a handaxe, can use

you r Strength modifier instead.

Bui ldi ngB rue nor , St e p 5

Bob writes down the starting equipment from the

fighter class and the folk hero background.

His starting

equipment includes chain mail and a shield, which

com bine to give Bruenor an Arm or Class of 18.

For Bruenor’sweapons, Bob chooses a battleaxe

and two handaxes.

His battleaxe is a melee weapon,

so Bruenor uses his Strength modifier for his attacks

and damage.

His attack bonus is his Strength modifier

(+3) plus his proficiency bonus (+2), for a total of +5.

The battleaxe deals 1d8 slashing damage, and Bruenor

adds his Strength modifier to the damage when he

hits, for a total of 1d8 + 3 slashing damage.

W hen

throwing a handaxe, Bruenor has the same attack bonus

(handaxes, as thrown weapons, use Strength for attacks

and damage), and the weapon deals 1d6 + 3 slashing

damage when it hits.

C

ome Tog eth e r

Most D&D characters don’t work alone.

Each character

plays a role with in a party, a group of adventurers

working together for a com m on purpose.

Teamwork

and cooperation greatly improve you r party’s chances

to survive the many perils in the worlds ofD ung eon s

& Dra gon s .

Talk to you r fellow players and you r DM

to decide whether you r characters know one another,

how the y met, and what sorts of quests the group

might undertake.

Bey ond 1st Lev e l

As you r character goes on adventures and overcom es

challenges, he or she gains experience, represented by

experience points.

A character w ho reaches a specified

experience point total advances in capability.

This

advancement is called gaining a level.

W hen you r character gains a level, his or her class

often grants additional features, as detailed in the

class description.

Som e of the se features allow you

to increase you r ability scores, either increasing two

scores by 1 each or increasing one score by 2.

You can’t

increase an ability score above 20.

In addition, every

character’s proficiency bonus increases at certain levels.

Each time you gain a level, you gain 1 additional Hit

Die.

Roll that Hit Die, add you r Constitution modifier

to the roll, and add the total to you r hit point maximum.

Alternatively, you can use the fixed value shown in you r

class entry, which is the average result of the die roll

(rounded up).

W hen you r Constitution modifier increases by 1, you r

hit point maximum increases by 1 for each level you have

attained.

For example, when Bruenor reaches 8th level

as a fighter, he increases his Constitution score from 17

to 18, thus increasing his Constitution modifier from +3

to +4.

His hit point maximum the n increases by 8.

The Character Advancement table sum m arizes the

XPyou need to advance in levels from level 1 through

level 20, and the proficiency bonus for a character of that

level.

Consult the information in you r character’s class

description to see what other improvements you gain

at each level.

### Tiersof Play

The shading in the Character Advancement table shows

the four tiers of play.

The tiers don’t have any rules

associated with the m; the y are a general description of how

the play experience changes as characters gain levels.

In the first tier (levels 1-4), characters are effectively

apprentice adventurers.

They are learning the features

that define the m as m em bers of particular classes,

including the major choices that flavor the ir class

features as the y advance (such as a wizard’s Arcane

Tradition or a fighter’s Martial Archetype).

The threats

the y face are relatively minor, usually posing a danger to

local farmsteads or villages.

In the second tier (levels 5-10), characters com e into

the ir own.

Many spellcasters gain access to 3rd-level

spells at the start of this tier, crossing a new threshold of

magical power with spells such as fireball and lightning

bolt.

At this tier, many weapon-using classes gain the

ability to make multiple attacks in one round.

These

characters have becom e important, facing dangers that

threaten cities and kingdoms.

In the third tier (levels 11-16), characters have

reached a level of power that sets the m high above

the ordinary populace and makes the m special even

am ong adventurers.

At 11th level, many spellcasters

gain access to 6th-level spells, som e of which create

effects previously im possible for player characters to

achieve.

Other characters gain features that allow the m

to make m ore attacks or do m ore impressive things with

those attacks.

These mighty adventurers often confront

threats to whole regions and continents.

At the fourth tier (levels 17-20), characters achieve

the pinnacle of the ir class features, becom ing heroic (or

villainous) archetypes in the ir own right.

The fate of the

world or even the fundamental order of the multiverse

might hang in the balance during the ir adventures.

## 2. Races

### Racial Tr

A VISIT TO ONE OF THE GREAT CITIES IN THE

worlds of Dun geo n s & Dra gon s —

Waterdeep, the Free City of Greyhawk, or

even uncanny Sigil, the City of D oors—

overwhelms the senses.

Voices chatter in

countless different languages.

The smells

of cooking in dozens ofdifferent cuisines

mingle with the odors of crow ded streets and poor

sanitation.

Buildings in myriad architectural styles

display the diverse origins of the ir inhabitants.

And the people the m selves—people of varying size,

shape, and color, dressed in a dazzling spectrum

of styles and hues—represent many different races,

from diminutive halflings and stout dwarves to

majestically beautiful elves, mingling am ong a variety

of human ethnicities.

Scattered am ong the m em bers of the se m ore com m on

races are the true exotics: a hulking dragonborn here,

pushing his way through the crowd, and a sly tiefling

the re, lurking in the shadows with m ischief in her eyes.

A group ofgnom es laughs as one of the m activates a

clever w ooden toy that m oves of its own accord.

Half-

elves and half-orcs live and work alongside humans,

with out fully belonging to the races of either of the ir

parents.

And the re, well out of the sunlight, is a lone

drow—a fugitive from the subterranean expanse of

the Underdark, trying to make his way in a world

that fears his kind.

Cho osi nga Race

Humans are the m ost com m on people in the w orlds of

D&D, but the y live and work alongside dwarves, elves,

halflings, and countless other fantastic species.

Your

character belongs to one of the se peoples.

Not every intelligent race of the multiverse is

appropriate for a player-controlled adventurer.

Dwarves,

elves, halflings, and humans are the m ost com m on

races to produce the sort of adventurers w ho make up

typical parties.

Dragonborn, gnom es, half-elves, half-

orcs, and tieflings are less com m on as adventurers.

Drow, a subrace of elves, are also uncom m on.

Your choice ofrace affects many different aspects of

you r character.

It establishes fundamental qualities that

exist throughout you r character’s adventuring career.

W hen making this decision, keep in mind the kind of

character you want to play.

For example, a halfling could

be a good choice for a sneaky rogue, a dwarf makes a

tough warrior, and an elf can be a master of arcane magic.

Your character race not only affects you r ability scores

and traits but also provides the cues for building you r

character’s story.

Each race’s description in this chapter

includes information to help you roleplay a character of

that race, including personality, physical appearance,

features ofsociety, and racial alignment tendencies.

These details are suggestions to help you think about

you r character; adventurers can deviate widely from the

norm for the ir race.

It’s worthwhile to consider why you r

character is different, as a helpful way to think about

you r character’s background and personality.

a

i t

s

The description of each race includes racial traits that

are com m on to m em bers of that race.

The following

entries appear am ong the traits of most races.

### Ability Score Increase

Every race increases one or m ore of a character’s

ability scores.

### Age

The age entry notes the age when amem ber ofthe race

is considered an adult, as well as the race’s expected

lifespan.

This information can help you decide how

old you r character is at the start of the game.

You

can choose any age for you r character, which could

provide an explanation for som e of you r ability scores.

For example, if you play a you ng or very old character,

you r age could explain a particularly low Strength or

Constitution score, while advanced age could account

for a high Intelligence or W isdom .

### Alignment

Most races have tendencies toward certain alignments,

described in this entry.

These are not binding for player

characters, but considering why you r dwarf is chaotic,

for example, in defiance of lawful dwarf society can help

you better define you r character.

S iz e

Characters of most races are Medium, a size category

including creatures that are roughly 4 to 8 feet tall.

M embers of a few races are Small (between 2 and 4 feet

tall), which means that certain rules of the game affect

the m differently.

The m ost important ofthese rules

is that Sm all characters have trouble w ielding heavy

weapons, as explained in chapter 6.

### Speed

Your speed determines how far you can move when

traveling (chapter 8) and fighting (chapter 9).

### Languages

By virtue of you r race, you r character can speak, read,

and write certain languages.

Chapter 4 lists the most

com m on languages of the D&D multiverse.

Su bra ces

Som e races have subraces.

M em bers of a subrace

have the traits of the parent race in addition to the

traits specified for the ir subrace.

Relationships am ong

subraces vary significantly from race to race and

world to world.

In the Dragonlance cam paign setting,

for example, mountain dwarves and hill dwarves live

together as different clans of the sam e people, but in

the Forgotten Realms, the y live far apart in separate

kingdom s and call the mselves shield dwarves and

gold dwarves, respectively.

### Stout

Bold and hardy, dwarves are known as

skilled warriors, miners, and workers

of stone and metal.

Though the y stand

well under 5 feet tall, dwarves are so

broad and compact that the y can weigh

as much as a human standing nearly two

feet taller.

Their courage and endurance

are also easily a match for any of

the larger folk.

Dwarven skin ranges from deep brown to a paler

hue tinged with red, but the most com m on shades are

light brown or deep tan, like certain tones of earth.

Their hair, worn long but in simple styles, is usually

black, gray, or brown, though paler dwarves often have

red hair.

Male dwarves value the ir beards highly and

groom the m carefully.

Lon gMe mor y , Lon gGr udg e s

Dwarves can live to be m ore than 400 years old, so the

oldest living dwarves often rem em ber a very different

world.

For example, som e of the oldest dwarves living

in Citadel Felbarr (in the world of the Forgotten Realms)

can recall the day, m ore than three centuries ago, when

orcs conquered the fortress and drove the m into an exile

that lasted over 250 years.

This longevity grants the m a

perspective on the world that shorter-lived races such as

humans and halflings lack.

Dwarves are solid and enduring like the mountains

the y love, weathering the passage of centuries with stoic

endurance and little change.

They respect the traditions

of the ir clans, tracing the ir ancestry back to the

founding oftheir m ost ancient strongholds in the you th

of the world, and don't abandon those traditions lightly.

Part of those traditions is devotion to the gods of the

dwarves, w ho uphold the dwarven ideals of industrious

labor, skill in battle, and devotion to the forge.

Individual dwarves are determined and loyal, true to

the ir w ord and decisive in action, som etim es to the point

of stubbornness.

Many dwarves have a strong sense

Kingdom s rich in ancient grandeur, halls carved into the

roots of mountains, the echoing of picks and hamm ers

in deep mines and blazing forges, a commitment to

clan and tradition, and a burning hatred of goblins and

orc s—the se com m on threads unite all dwarves.

“Yer lat e , elf !” cam eth ero ugh edg eof afa m il ia r

voice.

Bruenor Battlehammer walked up the back of his

dead foe, disregarding the fact that the heavy monster lay

on top of his elven friend.

In spite of the added discomfort,

the dwarf’s long, pointed, often-broken nose and gray-

streaked though still-fiery red beard came as a welcome

sight to Drizzt. “Knew I’d find ye in trouble if I came out

an' looked for ye!"

—R.

A .

Salvatore, The Crystal Shard

### Dwarf

ofjustice, and the y are slow to forget w rongs the y have

suffered.

Awrong done to one dwarf is awrong done to

the dwarf’s entire clan, so what begins as one dwarf’s

hunt for vengeance can becom eafull-blown clan feud.

### Clansand Kingdoms

Dwarven kingdom s stretch deep beneath the mountains

where the dwarves mine gems and precious metals

and forge items of wonder.

They love the beauty and

artistry of precious metals and fine jewelry, and in som e

dwarves this love festers into avarice.

Whatever wealth

the y can’t find in the ir mountains, the y gain through

trade.

They dislike boats, so enterprising humans and

halflings frequently handle trade in dwarven goods

along water routes.

Trustworthy m em bers of other races

are w elcom e in dwarf settlements, though som e areas

are off limits even to the m.

The chief unit of dwarven society is the clan, and

dwarves highly value social standing.

Even dwarves

who live far from the ir own kingdom s cherish the ir clan

identities and affiliations, recognize related dwarves,

and invoke the ir ancestors’ names in oaths and curses.

To be clanless is the worst fate that can befall a dwarf.

Dwarves in other lands are typically artisans,

especially weaponsm iths, armorers, and jewelers.

Som e

becom emercenaries or bodyguards, highly sought after

for the ir courage and loyalty.

God s , Gol d , and Cla n

Dwarves w ho take up the adventuring life might be

motivated by a desire for treasure—for its own sake, for

a specific purpose, or even out of an altruistic desire to

help others.

Other dwarves are driven by the com m and

or inspiration of a deity, a direct calling or simply a

desire to bring glory to one of the dwarf gods.

Clan and

ancestry are also important motivators.

A dwarf might

seek to restore a clan’s lost honor, avenge an ancient

wrong the clan suffered, or earn a new place with in the

clan after having been exiled.

Or a dwarf might search

for the axe w ielded by a mighty ancestor, lost on the field

of battle centuries ago.

### Slowto Trust

Dwarves get along passably well with most other races. “The

difference between an acquaintance and a friend is about a

hundred years,” is a dwarf saying that might be hyperbole,

but certainly points to how difficult it can be for a member of

a short-lived race like humans to earn a dwarf’s trust.

Elves. “ It’s not wise to depend on the elves.

No telling what

an elf will do next; when the hammer meets the orc’s head,

the y’re as apt to start singing as to pull out a sword.

They’re

flighty and frivolous.

Two things to be said for the m, though:

They don’t have many smiths, but the ones the y have do very

fine work.

And when orcs or goblins come streaming down

out of the mountains, an elf’s good to have at you r back.

Not

as good as a dwarf, maybe, but no doubt the y hate the orcs

as much as we do.”

Halflings. “Sure, the y’re pleasant folk.

But show me a

halfling hero.

An empire, a triumphant army.

Even a treasure

for the ages made by halfling hands.

Nothing.

How can you

take the m seriously?”

Humans. “You take the time to get to know a human, and

by the n the human’s on her deathbed.

If you’re lucky, she’s

got kin— a daughter or granddaughter, maybe— who’s got

hands and heart as good as hers.

That’s when you can make

a human friend.

And watch the m go!

They set the ir hearts on

something, the y’ll get it, whether it’sadragon’s hoard or an

empire’s throne.

You have to admire that kind of dedication,

even if it gets the m in trouble more often than not.”

### Dwarf Names

A dwarf’s name is granted by a clan elder, in accordance

with tradition.

Every proper dwarven name has been

used and reused down through the generations.

A

dw arf’s name belongs to the clan, not to the individual.

A dwarf w ho m isuses or brings shame to a clan name

is stripped of the name and forbidden by law to use any

dwarven name in its place.

### Dwarf Traits

Your dwarf character has an assortm ent of inborn

abilities, part and parcel of dwarven nature.

Ability Score Increase.

Your Constitution score

increases by 2.

Age.

Dwarves mature at the sam e rate as humans, but

the y’re considered you ng until the y reach the age of 50.

On average, the y live about 350 years.

Alignment.

Most dwarves are lawful, believing firmly

in the benefits of a well-ordered society.

They tend

toward good as well, with a strong sense of fair play and

a belief that everyone deserves to share in the benefits of

a just order.

Size.

Dwarves stand between 4 and 5 feet tall and

average about 150 pounds.

Your size is Medium.

Speed.

Your base walking speed is 25 feet.

Your

speed is not reduced by wearing heavy armor.

Darkvision.

Accustom ed to life underground, you

have superior vision in dark and dim conditions.

You

can see in dim light with in 60 feet of you as if it were

bright light, and in darkness as if it were dim light.

You

can’t discern color in darkness, only shades of gray.

Dwarven Resilience.

You have advantage on saving

throws against poison, and you have resistance against

poison damage (explained in chapter 9).

Dwarven Combat Training.

You have proficiency

and warhammer.

Tool Proficiency.

You gain proficiency with the

artisan’s tools of you r choice: smith’s tools, brewer’s

supplies, or m ason’s tools.

Stonecunning.

W henever you make an Intelligence

(History) check related to the origin of stonework, you

are considered proficient in the History skill and add

double you r proficiency bonus to the check, instead of

you r normal proficiency bonus.

Languages.

You can speak, read, and write Com m on

and Dwarvish.

Dwarvish is full of hard consonants and

guttural sounds, and those characteristics spill over into

what ever other language a dwarf might speak.

Subrace.

Two main subraces ofdwarves populate the

worlds of D&D: hill dwarves and mountain dwarves.

Choose one of the se subraces.

### Hill Dwarf

As a hill dwarf, you have keen senses, deep intuition,

and remarkable resilience.

The gold dwarves of Faerun

in the ir mighty southern kingdom are hill dwarves, as

are the exiled Neidar and the debased Klar of Krynn in

the Dragonlance setting.

Ability Score Increase.

Your W isdom score

increases by 1.

Dwarven Toughness.

Your hit point maximum

increases by 1, and it increases by 1 every time you

gain a level.

### Mountain Dwarf

As a mountain dwarf, you're strong and hardy,

accustom ed to a difficult life in rugged terrain.

You’re

probably on the tall side (for a dwarf), and tend toward

lighter coloration.

The shield dwarves of northern

Faerun, as well as the ruling Hylar clan and the noble

Daewar clan of Dragonlance, are mountain dwarves.

Ability Score Increase.

Your Strength score

increases by 2.

Dwarven Armor Training.

You have proficiency with

light and medium armor.

### Duergar

In cities deep in the Underdark live the duergar, or gray

dwarves.

These vicious, stealthy slave traders raid the surface

world for captives, the n sell the ir prey to the other races of

the Underdark.

They have innate magical abilities to become

invisible and to temporarily grow to giant size.

E lf

“I HAVE NEVER IMAGINED SUCH BEAUTY EXISTED,”

Goldmoon said softly.

The day’s march had been difficult,

but the reward at the end was beyond the ir dreams.

The companions stood on a high cliff over the fabled

city of Qualinost.

Four slender spires rose from the city’s corners like glisten-

ing spindles, the ir brilliant white stone marbled with shining

silver.

Graceful arches, swooping from spire to spire, soared

through the air.

Crafted by ancient dwarven metalsmiths,

the y were strong enough to hold the weight of an army, yet

the y appeared so delicate that a bird lighting on the m might

overthrow the balance.

These glistening arches were the

city’s only boundaries; the re was no wall around Qualinost.

The elven city opened its arms lovingly to the wilderness.

—M argaret W eis & Tracy H ickm an,

Dragons of Autumn Twilight

Elves are a magical people of otherworldly grace, living

in the world but not entirely part of it.

They live in

places of ethereal beauty, in the midst of ancient forests

or in silvery spires glittering with faerie light, where

soft music drifts through the air and gentle fragrances

waft on the breeze.

Elves love nature and magic, art

and artistry, music and poetry, and the good things

of the world.

### Slenderand Graceful

With the ir unearthly grace and fine features, elves

appear hauntingly beautiful to humans and mem bers

of many other races.

They are slightly shorter than

humans on average, ranging from well under 5 feet

tall to just over 6 feet.

They are m ore slender than

humans, weighing only 100 to 145 pounds.

Males and

females are about the same height, and males are only

marginally heavier than females.

Elves’ coloration encom passes the normal human

range and also includes skin in shades of copper,

bronze, and almost bluish-white, hair of green or blue,

and eyes like pools of liquid gold or silver.

Elves have no

facial and little body hair.

They favor elegant clothing in

bright colors, and the y enjoy simple yet lovely jewelry.

ATi mel ess Per spe cti v e

Elves can live well over 700 years, giving the m a broad

perspective on events that might trouble the shorter-

lived races m ore deeply.

They are m ore often amused

than excited, and m ore likely to be curious than

greedy.

They tend to remain aloof and unfazed by petty

happenstance.

W hen pursuing a goal, however, whether

adventuring on a mission or learning a new skill or art,

elves can be focused and relentless.

They are slow to

make friends and enemies, and even slower to forget

the m.

They reply to petty insults with disdain and to

serious insults with vengeance.

Like the branches of a you ng tree, elves are flexible

in the face of danger.

They trust in diplomacy and

com prom ise to resolve differences before the y escalate

to violence.

They have been known to retreat from

intrusions into the ir w oodland homes, confident

that the y can simply wait the invaders out.

But when

the need arises, elves reveal a stern martial side,

demonstrating skill with sword, bow, and strategy.

### Hidden Woodland Realms

Most elves dwell in small forest villages hidden am ong

the trees.

Elves hunt game, gather food, and grow

vegetables, and the ir skill and magic allow the m to

support the mselves with out the need for clearing and

plowing land.

They are talented artisans, crafting finely

worked clothes and art objects.

Their contact with

outsiders is usually limited, though a few elves make a

good living by trading crafted items for metals (which

the y have no interest in mining).

Elves encountered outside the ir own lands are

com m only traveling minstrels, artists, or sages.

Human

nobles com pete for the services of elf instructors to

teach swordplay or magic to the ir children.

### Explorationand Adventure

Elves take up adventuring out of wanderlust.

Since

the y are so long-lived, the y can enjoy centuries of

exploration and discovery.

They dislike the pace of

human society, which is regimented from day to day but

constantly changing over decades, so the y find careers

that let the m travel freely and set the ir own pace.

Elves

also enjoy exercising the ir martial prowess or gaining

greater magical power, and adventuring allows the m

to do so.

Som e might join with rebels fighting against

oppression, and others might becom e champions of

moral causes.

### Elf Names

Elves are considered children until the y declare

the mselves adults, som e time after the hundredth

birthday, and before this period the y are called

by child names.

On declaring adulthood, an elf selects an adult name,

although those w ho knew him or her as a you ngster

might continue to use the child name.

Each elf’s adult

name is a unique creation, though it might reflect

the names ofrespected individuals or other family

mem bers.

Little distinction exists between male

names and female names; the groupings here reflect

only general tendencies.

In addition, every elf bears a

family name, typically a com bination of other Elvish

words.

Som e elves traveling am ong humans translate

the ir family names into Com m on, but others retain the

Elvish version.

Child Names: Ara, Bryn, Del, Eryn, Faen, Innil.

Lael, Mella, Naill, Naeris, Phann, Rael, Rinn, Sai,

Syllin, Thia, Vall

Male Adult Names: Adran, Aelar, Aramil, Arannis,

Rolen, Soveliss, Thamior, Tharivol, Theren, Varis

### Haughtybut Gracious

Although the y can be haughty, elves are generally gracious

even to those who fall short of the ir high expectations—

which is most non-elves.

Still, the y can find good in just

about anyone.

Dwarves. “ Dwarves are dull, clumsy oafs.

But what the y

lack in humor, sophistication, and manners, the y make up in

valor.

And I must admit, the ir best smiths produce art that

approaches elven quality.”

Halflings. “ Halflings are people of simple pleasures, and

that is not a quality to scorn.

They’re good folk, the y care

for each other and tend the ir gardens, and the y have proven

the mselves tougher than the y seem when the need arises."

Humans. “All that haste, the ir ambition and drive to

accomplish something before the ir brief lives pass away—

human endeavors seem so futile sometimes.

But the n

you look at what the y have accomplished, and you have to

appreciate the ir achievements.

If only the y could slow down

and learn some refinement.”

Age.

Although elves reach physical maturity at about

the sam e age as humans, the elven understanding of

adulthood goes beyond physical growth to encom pass

worldly experience.

An elf typically claim s adulthood

and an adult name around the age of 100 and can live

to be 750 years old.

Alignment.

Elves love freedom, variety, and self-

expression, so the y lean strongly toward the gentler

aspects of chaos.

They value and protect others'

freedom as well as the ir own, and the y are more

often good than not.

The drow are an exception; the ir

exile into the Underdark has made the m vicious and

dangerous.

D row are m ore often evil than not.

Size.

Elves range from under 5 to over 6 feet tall and

have slender builds.

Your size is Medium.

Speed.

Your base walking speed is 30 feet.

Darkvision.

Accustom ed to twilit forests and the night

sky, you have superior vision in dark and dim conditions.

You can see in dim light with in 60 feet of you as if it

were bright light, and in darkness as if it were dim light.

You can’t discern color in darkness, only shades of gray.

Keen Senses.

You have proficiency in the

Perception skill.

Fey Ancestry.

You have advantage on saving throws

against being charmed, and magic can’t put you to sleep.

Trance.

Elves don’t need to sleep.

Instead, the y

meditate deeply, remaining sem iconscious, for 4

hours a day. (The Com m on word for such meditation

is “trance.”) W hile meditating, you can dream after a

fashion; such dream s are actually mental exercises that

have becom e reflexive through years of practice.

After

resting in this way, you gain the sam e benefit that a

human does from 8 hours of sleep.

Languages.

You can speak, read, and write Com m on

and Elvish.

Elvish is fluid, with subtle intonations and

intricate grammar.

Elven literature is rich and varied,

and the ir songs and poem s are famous am ong other

races.

Many bards learn the ir language so the y can add

Elvish ballads to the ir repertoires.

Subrace.

Ancient divides am ong the elven people

resulted in three main subraces: high elves, w ood elves,

and dark elves, who are com m only called drow.

Choose

one of the se subraces.

In som e worlds, the se subraces

are divided still further (such as the sun elves and m oon

elves of the Forgotten Realms), so if you wish, you can

choose a narrower subrace.

### High Elf

As a high elf, you have a keen mind and a mastery of

at least the basics of magic.

In many of the worlds

of D&D, the re are two kinds of high elves.

One type

(which includes the gray elves and valley elves of

Greyhawk, the Silvanesti of Dragonlance, and the

sun elves of the Forgotten Realms) is haughty and

reclusive, believing the mselves to be superior to

non-elves and even other elves.

The other type

(including the high elves of Greyhawk. the

Qualinesti of Dragonlance, and the m oon elves

of the Forgotten Realms) are m ore com m on

and m ore friendly, and often encountered

am ong humans and other races.

The sun elves of Faerun (also called gold

elves or sunrise elves) have bronze skin and

hair of copper, black, or golden blond.

Their

eyes are golden, silver, or black.

M oon elves (also

called silver elves or gray elves) are much paler,

with alabaster skin som etim es tinged with blue.

They often have hair of silver-white, black, or blue,

but various shades of blond, brown, and red are

not uncom m on.

Their eyes are blue or green and

flecked with gold.

As awood elf, you have keen senses and intuition, and

you r fleet feet carry you quickly and stealthily through

you r native forests.

This category includes the wild

elves (grugach) of Greyhawk and the Kagonesti of

Dragonlance, as well as the races called w ood elves in

Greyhawk and the Forgotten Realms.

In Faerun, w ood

elves (also called wild elves, green elves, or forest elves)

are reclusive and distrusting ofnon-elves.

W ood elves’ skin tends to be copperish in hue,

som etim es with traces of green.

Their hair tends toward

browns and blacks, but it is occasionally blond or

copper-colored.

Their eyes are green, brown, or hazel.

### The Darknessofthe Drow

Were it not for one renowned exception, the race of drow

would be universally reviled.

To most, the y are a race of

demon-worshiping marauders dwelling in the subterranean

depths of the Underdark, emerging only on the blackest

nights to pillage and slaughter the surface dwellers the y

despise.

Their society is depraved and preoccupied with the

favor of Lolth, the ir spider-goddess, who sanctions murder

and the extermination of entire families as noble houses

vie for position.

Yet one drow, at least, broke the mold.

In the world of the

Forgotten Realms, Drizzt Do'Urden, ranger of the North, has

proven his quality as a good-hearted defender of the weak

and innocent.

Rejecting his heritage and adrift in a world that

looks upon him with terror and loathing, Drizzt is a model

for those few drow who follow in his footsteps, trying to find

a life apart from the evil society of the ir Underdark homes.

Drow grow up believing that surface-dwelling races are

inferior, worthless except as slaves.

Drow who develop a

conscience or find it necessary to cooperate with members of

other races find it hard to overcome that prejudice, especially

when the y are so often on the receiving end of hatred.

Dar kEl f ( Dro w )

D escended from an earlier subrace of dark-skinned

elves, the drow were banished from the surface world

for following the goddess Lolth down the path to

evil and corruption.

Now the y have built the ir own

civilization in the depths of the Underdark, patterned

after the Way of Lolth.

Also called dark elves, the drow

have black skin that resem bles polished obsidian and

stark white or pale yellow hair.

They com m only have

very pale eyes (so pale as to be mistaken for white) in

shades of lilac, silver, pink, red, and blue.

They tend to

be smaller and thinner than m ost elves.

Drow adventurers are rare, and the race does not exist

in all worlds.

if you can play a drow character.

hundreds of miles in any direction, locked his fingers be-

hind his head and leaned back against the mossy blanket

of the tree trunk.

Regis was short, even by the standards

of his diminutive race, with the fluff ofhis curly brown

locks barely cresting the three-foot mark, but his belly was

amply thickened by his love of a good meal, or several, as

the opportunities presented the mselves.

The crooked stick

that served as his fishing pole rose up above him, clenched

between two of his toes, and hung out over the quiet lake,

mirrored perfectly in the glassy surface of Maer Dualdon.

lives: a place to settle in peace and quiet, far from

marauding monsters and clashing armies; a blazing fire

and a generous meal; fine drink and fine conversation.

Though som e halflings live out the ir days in remote

agricultural communities, others form nomadic bands

that travel constantly, lured by the open road and the

wide horizon to discover the w onders of new lands and

peoples.

But even the se wanderers love peace, food,

hearth, and home, though home might be a wagon

jostling along an dirt road or a raft floating downriver.

### Smalland Pr

a

c

t

i c

a

l

The diminutive halflings survive in a world full of larger

creatures by avoiding notice or, barring that, avoiding

offense.

Standing about 3 feet tall, the y appear relatively

harm less and so have managed to survive for centuries

in the shadow of empires and on the edges ofwars and

political strife.

They are inclined to be stout, weighing

between 40 and 45 pounds.

Halflings’ skin ranges from tan to pale with a ruddy

cast, and the ir hair is usually brown or sandy brown

and wavy.

They have brown or hazel eyes.

Halfling men

often sport long sideburns, but beards are rare among

the m and mustaches even m ore so.

They like to wear

simple, comfortable, and practical clothes, favoring

bright colors.

Halfling practicality extends beyond the ir clothing.

They’re concerned with basic needs and simple

pleasures and have little use for ostentation.

Even the

wealthiest of halflings keep the ir treasures locked in a

cellar rather than on display for all to see.

They have

a knack for finding the most straightforward solution

to a problem, and have little patience for dithering.

### Kindand Curious

Halflings are an affable and cheerful people.

They

cherish the bonds of family and friendship as well

as the com forts of hearth and home, harboring few

dream s of gold or glory.

Even adventurers among

the m usually venture into the world for reasons of

### Affableand Positive

community, friendship, wanderlust, or curiosity.

They

love discovering new things, even simple things, such

as an exotic food or an unfamiliar style of clothing.

Halflings are easily m oved to pity and hate to see any

living thing suffer.

They are generous, happily sharing

what the y have even in lean times.

### Blendintothe Crowd

Halflings are adept at fitting into a community of

humans, dwarves, or elves, making the mselves valuable

and w elcom e.

The combination of the ir inherent stealth

and the ir unassum ing nature helps halflings to avoid

unwanted attention.

Halflings w ork readily with others, and the y are loyal

to the ir friends, whether halfling or otherwise.

They can

display remarkable ferocity when the ir friends, families,

or com m unities are threatened.

### Pastoral Pleasantries

M ost halflings live in small, peaceful communities with

large farms and well-kept groves.

They rarely build

kingdom sof the ir own or even hold much land beyond

the ir quiet shires.

They typically don’t recognize any

sort of halfling nobility or royalty, instead looking to

family elders to guide the m.

Families preserve the ir

traditional ways despite the rise and fall of empires.

Many halflings live am ong other races, where the

halflings’ hard work and loyal outlook offer the m

abundant rewards and creature com forts.

S om e halfling

com m unities travel as a way of life, driving wagons or

guiding boats from place to place and maintaining no

permanent home.

Halflings try to get along with everyone else and are loath to

make sweeping generalizations— especially negative ones.

Dwarves. “Dwarves make loyal friends, and you can count

on the m to keep the ir word.

But would it hurt the m to smile

once in a while?”

Elves. "They’re so beautiful!

Their faces, the ir music, the ir

grace and all.

It’s like the y stepped out of a wonderful dream.

But the re’s no telling what’s going on behind the ir smiling

faces— surely more than the y ever let on.”

Humans. “ Humans are a lot like us, really.

At least some

of the m are.

Step out of the castles and keeps, go talk to the

farmers and herders and you’ll find good, solid folk.

Not that

the re’s anything wrong with the barons and soldiers—you

have to admire the ir conviction.

And by protecting the ir own

lands, the y protect us as well.”

### Exploring Opportunities

Halflings usually set out on the adventurer’s path to

defend the ir communities, support the ir friends, or

explore a wide and wonder-filled world.

For the m,

adventuring is less a career than an opportunity or

som etim es a necessity.

### Halfling Names

A halfling has a given name, a family name, and possibly

a nickname.

Family nam es are often nicknam es that

stuck so tenaciously the y have been passed down

through the generations.

Male Names: Alton, Ander, Cade, Corrin, Eldon, Errich,

Languages.

You can speak, read, and write Com m on

The Halfling language isn’t secret, but

halflings are loath to share it with others.

They write

very little, so the y don’t have a rich body ofliterature.

Their oral tradition, however, is very strong.

In the Forgotten

Realms, lightfoot halflings have spread the farthest and

thus are the most com m on variety.

Lightfoots are m ore prone to wanderlust than other

### Human

The sew ere the sto r ie sof are stl ess peo ple who

long ago took to the seas and rivers in longboats, first to

pillage and terrorize, the n to settle.

Yet the re was an energy,

a love of adventure, that sang from every page.

Long into

the night Uriel read, lighting candle after precious candle.

She'd never given much thought to humans, but the se

stories fascinated her.

In the se yellowed pages were tales of

bold heroes, strange and fierce animals, mighty primitive gods,

and a magic that was part and fabric of that distant land.

—Elaine C unningham , Daughter of the Drow

In the reckonings ofmost worlds, humans are the

you ngest of the com m on races, late to arrive on the

world scene and short-lived in com parison to dwarves,

elves, and dragons.

Perhaps it is because of the ir shorter

lives that the y strive to achieve as much as the y can in

the years the y are given.

Or maybe the y feel the y have

som ething to prove to the elder races, and that’s why

the y build the ir mighty empires on the foundation of

conquest and trade.

Whatever drives the m, humans

are the innovators, the achievers, and the pioneers

of the worlds.

ABr oad Spe ctr u m

With the ir penchant for migration and conquest,

humans are m ore physically diverse than other com m on

races.

There is no typical human.

An individual can

stand from 5 feet to a little over 6 feet tall and weigh

from 125 to 250 pounds.

Human skin shades range

from nearly black to very pale, and hair colors from

black to blond (curly, kinky, or straight); males might

sport facial hair that is sparse or thick.

A lot of humans

have a dash of nonhuman blood, revealing hints of elf,

orc , or other lineages.

Humans reach adulthood in the ir

late teens and rarely live even a single century.

### Varietyin All Things

Humans are the m ost adaptable and ambitious people

am ong the com m on races.

They have widely varying

tastes, morals, and customs in the many different lands

where the y have settled.

W hen the y settle, though,

the y stay: the y build cities to last for the ages, and

great kingdom s that can persist for long centuries.

An

individual human might have a relatively short life span,

but a human nation or culture preserves traditions

with origins far beyond the reach of any single human’s

memory.

They live fully in the present—making the m

well suited to the adventuring life—but also plan for the

future, striving to leave a lasting legacy.

Individually and

as a group, humans are adaptable opportunists, and

the y stay alert to changing political and social dynamics.

Ev ery one ’sSe con d - Bes tFr ien d s

Just as readily as the y mix with each other, humans mingle

with members of other races.

They get along with almost

everyone, though the y might not be close to many.

Humans

serve as ambassadors, diplomats, magistrates, merchants,

and functionaries of all kinds.

Dwarves. “They’re stout folk, stalwart friends, and true to

the ir word.

Their greed for gold is the ir downfall, though.”

Elves. “It’s best not to wander into elven woods.

They don't

like intruders, and you’ll as likely be bewitched as peppered

with arrows.

Still, if an elf can get past that damned racial

pride and actually treat you like an equal, you can learn a lot

from the m.”

Halflings. "It’s hard to beat a meal in a halfling home, as

long as you don’t crack you r head on the ceiling— good food

and good stories in front of a nice, warm fire.

If halflings had

a shred of ambition, the y might really amount to something.”

### Lasting Institutions

W here a single elf or dwarf might take on the

responsibility of guarding a special location or a

powerful secret, humans found sacred orders and

institutions for such purposes.

W hile dwarf clans and

halfling elders pass on the ancient traditions to each

new generation, human temples, governments, libraries,

and codes of law fix the ir traditions in the bedrock of

history.

Humans dream of immortality, but (except for

those few who seek undeath or divine ascension to

escape death’s clutches) the y achieve it by ensuring that

the y will be rem em bered when the y are gone.

Although som e humans can be xenophobic, in

general the ir societies are inclusive.

Human lands

welcom e large numbers of nonhumans com pared to the

proportion of humans w ho live in nonhuman lands.

### Exemplarsof Ambition

Humans w ho seek adventure are the most daring and

ambitious m em bers of a daring and ambitious race.

They seek to earn glory in the eyes of the ir fellows

by am assing power, wealth, and fame.

More than

other people, humans champion causes rather than

territories or groups.

### Human Namesand Ethnicities

Having so much m ore variety than other cultures,

humans as a whole have no typical names.

### Calishite

Shorter and slighter in build than m ost other humans,

Humans of

Chondathan descent dominate the central lands of

Faerun. around the Inner Sea.

parents give the ir children names from other languages,

such as Dwarvish or Elvish (pronounced m ore or less

correctly), but most parents give names that are linked

to the ir region’s culture or to the naming traditions of

the ir ancestors.

The material culture and physical characteristics

of humans can change wildly from region to region.

In the Forgotten Realms, for example, the clothing,

architecture, cuisine, music, and literature are different

in the northwestern lands of the Silver M arches than

in distant Turmish or Impiltur to the east—and even

more distinctive in far-off Kara-Tur.

Human physical

characteristics, though, vary according to the ancient

migrations of the earliest humans, so that the humans

of the Silver M arches have every possible variation of

coloration and features.

In the Forgotten Realms, nine human ethnic groups

are widely recognized, though over a dozen others are

found in m ore localized areas of Faerun.

These groups,

and the typical nam es oftheir mem bers, can be used as

inspiration no matter which world you r human is in.

the m with fearful incom prehension.

Shaped by draconic

gods or the dragons the mselves, dragonborn originally

hatched from dragon eggs as a unique race, com bining

the best attributes of dragons and humanoids.

Som e

dragonborn are faithful servants to true dragons, others

form the ranks ofsoldiers in great wars, and still others

find the mselves adrift, with no clear calling in life.

### Proud Dragon Kin

Dragonborn look very much like dragons standing erect

in humanoid form, though the y lack wings or a tail.

The

first dragonborn had scales of vibrant hues matching

the colors of the ir dragon kin, but generations of

interbreeding have created amore uniform appearance.

Their small, fine scales are usually brass or bronze

in color, som etim es ranging to scarlet, rust, gold, or

copper-green.

They are tall and strongly built, often

standing close to 6 1/2 feet tall and weighing 300 pounds

or more.

Their hands and feet are strong, talonlike

claws with three fingers and a thumb on each hand.

The blood of a particular type of dragon runs

very strong through som e dragonborn clans.

These

dragonborn often boast scales that m ore closely match

those of the ir dragon ancestor—bright red, green, blue,

or white, lustrous black, or gleam ing metallic gold,

silver, brass, copper, or bronze.

Sel f - Suf fic ien tCl ans

To any dragonborn, the clan is m ore important than

life itself.

Dragonborn owe the ir devotion and respect

to the ir clan above all else, even the gods.

Each

dragonborn’s conduct reflects on the honor of his or her

clan, and bringing dishonor to the clan can result in

expulsion and exile.

Each dragonborn knows his or her

station and duties with in the clan, and honor demands

maintaining the bounds of that position.

A continual drive for self-improvement reflects the

self-sufficiency of the race as a whole.

Dragonborn value

skill and excellence in all endeavors.

They hate to fail,

and the y push the mselves to extreme efforts before the y

give up on something.

A dragonborn holds mastery of

a particular skill as a lifetime goal.

M embers of other

races w ho share the sam e commitment find it easy to

earn the respect ofa dragonborn.

Though all dragonborn strive to be self-sufficient,

the y recognize that help is som etim es needed in difficult

situations.

But the best source for such help is the

clan, and when a clan needs help, it turns to another

dragonborn clan before seeking aid from other races—

or even from the gods.

### Dragonborn Names

Dragonborn have personal nam es given at birth,

but the y put the ir clan names first as a mark of

honor.

A childhood name or nicknam e is often used

am ong clutchmates as a descriptive term or a term

of endearment.

The name might recall an event or

center on a habit.

Male Names: Arjhan, Balasar, Bharash, Donaar, Ghesh.

Heskan, Kriv, Medrash, Mehen, Nadarr, Pandjed,

Patrin, Rhogar, Shamash, Shedinn, Tarhun, Torinn

Female Names: Akra, Biri, Daar, Farideh, Harann,

Flavilar, Jheri, Kava, Korinn, Mishann, Nala, Perra,

Raiann, Sora, Surina, Thava, Uadjit

### Uncommon Races

The dragonborn and the rest of the races in this chapter are

uncommon.

They don’t exist in every world of D&D, and

even where the y are found, the y are less widespread than

dwarves, elves, halflings, and humans.

In the cosmopolitan cities of the D&D multiverse, most

people hardly look twice at members of even the most

exotic races.

But the small towns and villages that dot

the countryside are different.

The common folk aren’t

accustomed to seeing members of the se races, and the y

react accordingly.

Dragonborn.

It’s easy to assume that a dragonborn is a

monster, especially if his or her scales betray a chromatic

heritage.

Unless the dragonborn starts breathing fire and

causing destruction, though, people are likely to respond

with caution rather than outright fear.

Gnome.

Gnomes don’t look like a threat and can quickly

disarm suspicion with good humor.

The common folk are

often curious about gnomes, likely never having seen one

before, but the y are rarely hostile or fearful.

Half-Elf.

Although many people have never seen a half-elf,

virtually everyone knows the y exist.

A half-elf stranger’s

arrival is followed by gossip behind the half-elf's back and

stolen glances across the common room, rather than any

confrontation or open curiosity.

Half-Orc.

It’s usually safe to assume that a half-orc is

belligerent and quick to anger, so people watch the mselves

around an unfamiliar half-orc.

Shopkeepers might

surreptitiously hide valuable or fragile goods when a half-orc

comes in, and people slowly clear out of a tavern, assuming a

fight will break out soon.

Tiefling.

Half-orcs are greeted with a practical caution, but

tieflings are the subject of supernatural fear.

The evil of the ir

heritage is plainly visible in the ir features, and as far as most

people are concerned, a tiefling could very well be a devil

straight from the Nine Hells.

People might make warding

signs as a tiefling approaches, cross the street to avoid

passing near, or bar shop doors before a tiefling can enter.

Childhood Names: Climber, Earbender, Leaper, Pious,

Shieldbiter, Zealous

Clan Names: Clethtinthiallor, Daardendrian, Delmirev,

Drachedandion, Fenkenkabradon, Kepeshkmolik,

Kerrhylon, Kimbatuul, Linxakasendalor, Myastan,

### Draconians

in the Dragonlance setting, the followers of the evil goddess

Takhisis learned a dark ritual that let the m corrupt the

eggs of metallic dragons, producing evil dragonborn called

draconians.

Five types of draconians, corresponding to the

five types of metallic dragons, fought for Takhisis in the War

of the Lance: auraks (gold), baaz (brass), bozak (bronze),

kapak (copper), and sivak (silver).

In place of the ir draconic

breath weapons, the y have unique magical abilities.

Draconic Ancestry.

You have draconic ancestry.

C hoose one type of dragon from the Draconic Ancestry

table.

Your breath weapon and damage resistance are

determined by the dragon type, as shown in the table.

Breath Weapon.

You can use you r action to exhale

destructive energy.

Your draconic ancestry determines

the size, shape, and damage type of the exhalation.

W hen you use you r breath weapon, each creature in

the area of the exhalation must make a saving throw,

the type of which is determined by you r draconic

ancestry.

The DC for this saving throw equals 8 +

you r Constitution m odifier + you r proficiency bonus.

A

creature takes 2d6 damage on a failed save, and half

as much damage on a successful one.

The damage

increases to 3d6 at 6th level, 4d6 at 11th level, and 5d6

at 16th level.

After you use you r breath weapon, you can’t use it

again until you complete a short or long rest.

Damage Resistance.

You have resistance to the

damage type associated with you r draconic ancestry.

Languages.

You can speak, read, and write Com m on

and Draconic.

Draconic is thought to be one of the

oldest languages and is often used in the study of magic.

The language sounds harsh to most other creatures and

includes num erous hard consonants and sibilants.

### Gnome

fair hair has a tendency to stick out in every direction,

as if expressing the gnom e’s insatiable interest in

everything around.

A gnom e’s personality is writ large in his or her

appearance.

A male gnom e’s beard, in contrast to

his wild hair, is kept carefully trimmed but often

styled into curious forks or neat points.

A gnom e’s

clothing, though usually made in m odest earth tones,

is elaborately decorated with embroidery, em bossing,

or gleam ing jewels.

### Delighted Dedication

As far as gnom es are concerned, being alive is a

wonderful thing, and the y squeeze every ounce of

enjoyment out of the ir three to five centuries of life.

Humans might w onder about getting bored over the

course of such a long life, and elves take plenty of time

to savor the beauties of the world in the ir long years, but

gnom es seem to worry that even with all that time, the y

can’t get in enough of the things the y want to do and see.

Gnom es speak as if the y can’t get the thoughts

out of the ir heads fast enough.

Even as the y offer

ideas and opinions on a range of subjects, the y still

manage to listen carefully to others, adding the

appropriate exclamations of surprise and appreciation

along the way.

Sk inn yan dfl axe n - hai red , h is skin

walnut brown and his eyes a startling

turquoise, Burgell stood half as tall as Aeron

climb up on a stool to look out the peephole.

Like most hab-

itations in Oeble, that particular tenement had been built

for humans, and smaller residents coped with the resulting

awkwardness as best the y could.

But at least the relative largeness of the apartment gave

Burgell room to pack in all his gnome-sized gear.

The front

room was his workshop, and it contained a bewildering

miscellany of tools: hammers, chisels, saws, lockpicks,

tinted lenses, jeweler's loupes, and jars of powdered and

shredded ingredients for casting spells.

A fat gray cat, the

mage’s familiar, lay curled atop a grimoire.

It opened its

eyes, gave Aeron a disdainful yellow stare, the n appeared

to go back to sleep.

—R ichard Lee Byers, The Black Bouquet

A constant hum ofbusy activity pervades the warrens

and neighborhoods where gnom es form the ir close-

knit communities.

Louder sounds punctuate the hum:

a crunch of grinding gears here, aminor explosion

the re, a yelp of surprise or triumph, and especially

bursts of laughter.

G nom es take delight in life, enjoying

every moment of invention, exploration, investigation,

creation, and play.

### Vibrant Expression

A gnom e’s energy and enthusiasm for living shines

through every inch of his or her tiny body.

Gnom es

average slightly over 3 feet tall and w eigh 40 to 45

pounds.

Their tan or brown faces are usually adorned

with broad sm iles (beneath the ir prodigious noses),

and the ir bright eyes shine with excitement.

Their

Though gnom es love jokes ofall kinds, particularly

puns and pranks, the y’re just as dedicated to the m ore

serious tasks the y undertake.

Many gnom es are skilled

engineers, alchemists, tinkers, and inventors.

They’re

will ing to make mistakes and laugh at the mselves in

the process of perfecting what the y do, taking bold

(som etim es foolhardy) risks and dream ing large.

### Bright Burrows

Gnom es make the ir hom es in hilly, w ooded lands.

They

live underground but get more fresh air than dwarves

do, enjoying the natural, living world on the surface

when ever the y can.

Their hom es are well hidden by

both clever construction and simple illusions.

W elcom e

visitors are quickly ushered into the bright, warm

burrows.

Those w ho are not w elcom e are unlikely to

find the burrows in the first place.

Gnom es w ho settle in human lands are com m only

gemcutters, engineers, sages, or tinkers.

Som e human

families retain gnom e tutors, ensuring that the ir pupils

enjoy a mix of serious learning and delighted enjoyment.

A gnom e might tutor several generations of a single

human family over the course of his or her long life.

### Gnome Names

Gnom es love names, and most have half a dozen or so.

A gnom e's mother, father, clan elder, aunts, and uncles

each give the gnom eaname, and various nicknam es

from just about everyone else might or might not stick

over time.

Gnom e names are typically variants on the

names of ancestors or distant relatives, though som e

are purely new inventions.

W hen dealing with humans

and others w ho are “stuffy” about names, a gnome

learns to use no m ore than three names: a personal

name, a clan name, and a nickname, choosing the one in

each category that’s the m ost fun to say.

### Deep Gnomes

A third subrace of gnomes, the deep gnomes (or svirfneblin),

live in small communities scattered in the Underdark.

Unlike

the duergar and the drow, svirfneblin are as good as the ir

surface cousins.

However, the ir humor and enthusiasm

are dampened by the ir oppressive environment, and the ir

inventive expertise is directed mostly toward stonework.

### Seeingthe World

Curious and impulsive, gnom es might take up

adventuring as a way to see the world or for the love

of exploring.

As lovers of gems and other fine items,

som e gnom es take to adventuring as a quick, if

dangerous, path to wealth.

Regardless ofwhat spurs

the m to adventure, gnom es w ho adopt this way of life

eke as much enjoyment out ofit as the y do out of any

other activity the y undertake, som etim es to the great

annoyance of the ir adventuring com panions.

around age 40.

They can live 350 to almost 500 years.

Alignment.

Gnom es are most often good.

Those who

tend toward law are sages, engineers, researchers,

scholars, investigators, or inventors.

Those w ho tend

toward chaos are minstrels, tricksters, wanderers,

or fanciful jewelers.

Gnom es are good-hearted, and

### Always Appreciative

It’s rare for a gnome to be hostile or malicious unless he

or she has suffered a grievous injury.

Gnomes know that

most races don’t share the ir sense of humor, but the y enjoy

anyone's company just as the y enjoy everything else the y set

out to do.

Languages.

You can speak, read, and write Com m on

The Gnomish language, which uses the

Dwarvish script, is renowned for its technical treatises

and its catalogs ofknowledge about the natural world.

Subrace.

Two subraces of gnom es are found among

the worlds of D&D: forest gnom es and rock gnom es.

Choose one of the se subraces.

### Forest Gnome

As a forest gnome, you have a natural knack for illusion

and inherent quickness and stealth.

In the worlds of

D&D, forest gnom es are rare and secretive.

They gather

in hidden com m unities in sylvan forests, using illusions

and trickery to conceal the mselves from threats or

to mask the ir escape should the y be detected.

Forest

gnom es tend to be friendly with other good-spirited

w oodland folk, and the y regard elves and good fey as

the ir most important allies.

These gnom es also befriend

small forest animals and rely on the m for information

about threats that might prowl the ir lands.

or smaller beasts.

Forest gnom es love animals and often

keep squirrels, badgers, rabbits, moles, w oodpeckers,

and other creatures as beloved pets.

### Rock Gnome

As a rock gnome, you have a natural inventiveness and

hardiness beyond that of other gnom es.

Most gnom es

in the worlds of D&D are rock gnom es, including the

tinker gnom es of the Dragonlance setting.

Ability Score Increase.

Your Constitution score

Artificer’s Lore.

W henever you make an Intelligence

(History) check related to magic items, alchemical

objects, or technological devices, you can add twice you r

proficiency bonus, instead of any proficiency bonus you

normally apply.

Tinker.

You have proficiency with artisan’s tools

(tinker’s tools).

Using those tools, you can spend 1

hour and 10 gp worth of materials to construct a Tiny

clockw ork device (AC 5, 1 hp).

The device ceases

to function after 24 hours (unless you spend 1 hour

repairing it to keep the device functioning), or when

you use you r action to dismantle it; at that time, you can

reclaim the materials used to create it.

You can have up

to three such devices active at a time.

W hen you create a device, choose one of the

following options:

Clockwork Toy.

This toy is a clockw ork animal, monster,

or person, such as a frog, mouse, bird, dragon, or

soldier.

W hen placed on the ground, the toy m oves

5 feet across the ground on each of you r turns in a

random direction.

It makes noises as appropriate

to the creature it represents.

Fire Starter.

The device produces a miniature

flame, which you can use to light a candle,

torch, or campfire.

Using the device

requires you r action.

Music Box.

W hen opened, this music box

plays a single song at a moderate volume.

The box stops playing when it

reaches the song’s end or

when it is closed.

“Tanis?” said Flint hesitantly as the man neared.

“The same.” The newcomer’s bearded face split in a wide

grin.

He held open his arms and, before the dwarf could

stop him, engulfed Flint in a hug that lifted him off the

ground.

The dwarf clasped his old friend close for a brief

instant, the n, remembering his dignity, squirmed and freed

himself from the half-elf’s embrace.

Dragons of Autumn Twilight

W alking in two w orlds but truly belonging to neither,

half-elves com bine what som e say are the best qualities

oftheir elf and human parents: human curiosity,

inventiveness, and ambition tempered by the refined

senses, love of nature, and artistic tastes ofthe elves.

S om e half-elves live am ong humans, set apart by the ir

emotional and physical differences, watching friends

and loved ones age while time barely touches the m.

Others live with the elves, growing restless as the y

reach adulthood in the timeless elven realms, while

the ir peers continue to live as children.

Many half-elves,

unable to fit into either society, choose lives of solitary

wandering or join with other misfits and outcasts in

the adventuring life.

### Of Two Worlds

To humans, half-elves look like elves, and to elves, the y

look human.

In height, the y’re on par with both parents,

though the y’re neither as slender as elves nor as broad

as humans.

They range from under 5 feet to about 6 feet

tall, and from 100 to 180 pounds, with men only slightly

taller and heavier than women.

Half-elf men do have

facial hair, and som etim es grow beards to mask the ir

elven ancestry.

Half-elven coloration and features lie

som ewhere between the ir human and elf parents, and

thus show a variety even m ore pronounced than that

found am ong either race.

They tend to have the eyes

of the ir elven parents.

he saw the figure of a man striding up the path.

Standing,

Flint drew back into the shadow of a tall pine to see better.

The man's walk was marked by an easy grace—an elvish

grace, Flint would have said; yet the man’s body had the

thickness and tight muscles of a human, while the facial

hair was definitely humankind’s.

All the dwarf could see

of the man’s face beneath a green hood was tan skin and a

brownish-red beard.

A longbow was slung over one shoulder

and a sword hung at his left side.

He was dressed in soft

leather, carefully tooled in the intricate designs the elves

loved.

But no elf in the world ofKrynn could grow a beard

### Diplomatsor Wanderers

Half-elves have no lands oftheir own, though the y are

w elcom e in human cities and som ewhat less w elcom e

in elven forests.

In large cities in regions where elves

and humans interact often, half-elves are som etim es

numerous enough to form small com m unities of the ir

own.

They enjoy the company of other half-elves, the

only people w ho truly understand what it is to live

between the se two worlds.

In most parts of the world, though, half-elves are

uncom m on enough that one might live for years

with out meeting another.

Som e half-elves prefer to

avoid company altogether, wandering the w ilds as

trappers, foresters, hunters, or adventurers and visiting

civilization only rarely.

Like elves, the y are driven by

the wanderlust that com es of the ir longevity.

Others,

in contrast, throw the mselves into the thick of society,

putting the ir charisma and social skills to great use

in diplomatic roles or as swindlers.

Hal f - Elf Nam e s

Half-elves use either human or elven naming

conventions.

As if to emphasize that the y don’t really fit

in to either society, half-elves raised am ong humans are

often given elven names, and those raised am ong elves

often take human names.

### Scarredand Strong

Half-orcs’ grayish pigmentation, sloping foreheads,

jutting jaws, prominent teeth, and towering builds make

the ir orcish heritage plain for all to see.

Half-orcs stand

between 6 and 7 feet tall and usually weigh between

180 and 250 pounds.

Orcs regard battle scars as tokens of pride and

ornamental scars as things of beauty.

Other scars,

though, mark an orc or half-orc as a former slave or

a disgraced exile.

Any half-orc who has lived among

or near orcs has scars, whether the y are marks of

humiliation or of pride, recounting the ir past exploits

and injuries.

Such a half-orc living am ong humans might

display the se scars proudly or hide the m in shame.

### The Markof Gruumsh

those orcs who turn away from his worship can’t fully

He

usually rose before most of his warriors, since he had a

strong streak of human blood in him, and he found the

daylight less bothersome than most of his tribe did.

Among

the Bloody Skulls, a warrior was judged by his strength, his

fierceness, and his wits.

Human ancestry was no blemish

against a warrior—provided he was every bit as strong,

enduring, and bloodthirsty as his full-blooded kin.

Half-

orcs who were weaker than the ir orc comrades didn't last

long among the Bloody Skulls or any other orc tribe for

that matter.

But it was often true that a bit of human blood

gave a warrior just the right mix of cunning, ambition, and

self-discipline to go far indeed, as Mhurren had.

He was

and the strongest chief in Thar.

Beyond the rage of Gruumsh, half-orcs feel emotion

powerfully.

Rage doesn’t just quicken the ir pulse, it

An insult stings like acid,

They tend to be short-tempered

and som etim es sullen, m ore inclined to action than

contemplation and to fighting than arguing.

The most

accom plished half-orcs are those with enough self-

control to get by in a civilized land.

### Tribesand Slums

Half-orcs most often live am ong orc s.

Of the other races,

humans are most likely to accept half-orcs, and half-

orcs almost always live in human lands when not living

am ong orc tribes.

W hether proving the mselves am ong

rough barbarian tribes or scrabbling to survive in the

slums of larger cities, half-orcs get by on the ir physical

might, the ir endurance, and the sheer determination

the y inherit from the ir human ancestry.

Hal f - Orc Nam e s

Half-orcs usually have names appropriate to the culture

in which the y were raised.

A half-orc w ho wants to fit in

am ong humans might trade an orc name for a human

name.

Som e half-orcs with human names decide to

adopt a guttural orc name because the y think it makes

the m m ore intimidating.

Male Orc Names: Dench, Feng, Gell, Henk, Holg, Imsh,

Keth, Krusk, Mhurren, Ront, Shump, Thokk

Female Orc Names: Baggi, Emen, Engong, Kansif,

Myev, Neega, Ovak, Ownka, Shautha, Sutha, Vola,

Volen, Yevelda

Hal f - Orc Tra its

Your half-orc character has certain traits deriving from

you r ore ancestry.

hate orcs.

Some are reserved, trying not to draw attention to

the mselves.

A few demonstrate piety and good-heartedness

as publicly as the y can (whether or not such demonstrations

are genuine).

And some simply try to be so tough that others

just avoid the m.

Ability Score Increase.

Your Strength score

increases by 2, and you r Constitution score

increases by 1.

Age.

Half-orcs mature a little faster than humans,

reaching adulthood around age 14.

They age

noticeably faster and rarely live longer than 75 years.

Alignment.

Half-orcs inherit a tendency toward chaos

from the ir orc parents and are not strongly inclined

toward good.

Half-orcs raised am ong ores and will ing

to live out the ir lives among the m are usually evil.

Size.

Half-orcs are som ewhat larger and bulkier than

humans, and the y range from 5 to well over 6 feet tall.

Your size is Medium.

Speed.

Your base walking speed is 30 feet.

Darkvision.

Thanks to you r orc blood, you have

superior vision in dark and dim conditions.

You can

see in dim light with in 60 feet of you as if it w ere bright

light, and in darkness as if it w ere dim light.

You can't

discern color in darkness, only shades ofgray.

Menacing.

You gain proficiency in the

Intimidation skill.

Relentless Endurance.

W hen you are reduced to

0 hit points but not killed outright, you can drop to 1 hit

point instead.

You can’t use this feature again until you

finish a long rest.

Savage Attacks.

W hen you score a critical hit with

a melee weapon attack, you can roll one of the weapon’s

damage dice one additional time and add it to the extra

damage of the critical hit.

Languages.

You can speak, read, and

write Com m on and Orc .

Orc is a

harsh, grating language with

hard consonants.

It has

no script of its own

but is written in the

Dwarvish script.

“ But you dose eth ewa ype opl elo oka t you ,

devil’s child."

Those black eyes, cold as a winter storm, were staring

right into her heart and the sudden seriousness in his

voice jolted her.

“What is it the y say?" he asked. “One’sacuriosity, two’s

a conspiracy—”

“Three'sacurse,” she finished. “You think I have n’t heard

that rubbish before?”

“I know you have.” When she glared at him, he added,

“It’s not as if I’m plumbing the depths of you r mind, dear

girl.

That is the burden of every tiefling.

Some break under

it, some make it the millstone around the ir neck, some

revel in it.” He tilted his head again, scrutinizing her, with

that wicked glint in his eyes. “You fight it, don’t you?

Like

a little wildcat, I wager.

Every little jab and comment just

sharpens you r claws.”

—Erin M .

Evans, Brimstone Angels

To be greeted with stares and whispers, to suffer

violence and insult on the street, to see mistrust and

fear in every eye: this is the lot of the tiefling.

And to

twist the knife, tieflings know that this is because a

pact struck generations ago infused the essence of

A sm odeus—overlord of the Nine Hells—into the ir

bloodline.

Their appearance and the ir nature are not

the ir fault but the result of an ancient sin, for which

the y and the ir children and the ir children’s children

will always be held accountable.

### Infernal Bloodline

Tieflings are derived from human bloodlines, and in the

broadest possible sense, the y still look human.

However,

the ir infernal heritage has left a clear imprint on the ir

appearance.

Tieflings have large horns that take any

of a variety of shapes: som e have curling horns like a

ram, others have straight and tall horns like a gazelle’s,

and som e spiral upward like an antelopes’ horns.

They

have thick tails, four to five feet long, which lash or coil

around the ir legs when the y get upset or nervous.

Their

canine teeth are sharply pointed, and the ir eyes are

solid colors—black, red, white, silver, or gold—with no

visible sclera or pupil.

Their skin tones cover the full

range of human coloration, but also include various

shades of red.

Their hair, cascading down from behind

the ir horns, is usually dark, from black or brown to dark

red, blue, or purple.

Sel f - Rel ian tan dSu spi cio u s

Tieflings subsist in small minorities found mostly in

human cities or towns, often in the roughest quarters

of those places, where the y grow up to be swindlers,

thieves, or crim e lords.

Som etim es the y live among

other minority populations in enclaves where the y are

treated with m ore respect.

Lacking a homeland, tieflings know that the y have

to make the ir own way in the w orld and that the y have

to be strong to survive.

They are not quick to trust

anyone w ho claim s to be a friend, but when a tiefling’s

com panions demonstrate that the y trust him or her,

the tiefling learns to extend the same trust to the m.

And once a tiefling gives som eone loyalty, the tiefling

is a firm friend or ally for life.

### Tiefling Names

Tiefling nam es fall into three broad categories.

Tieflings

born into another culture typically have nam es reflective

of that culture.

Som e have names derived from the

Infernal language, passed down through generations,

that reflect the ir fiendish heritage.

And som e you nger

tieflings, striving to find a place in the world, adopt a

name that signifies a virtue or other concept and the n

try to em body that concept.

For som e, the chosen name

is a noble quest.

For others, it’sagrim destiny.

Male Infernal Names: Akm enos, Am non, Barakas,

Damakos, Ekemon, Iados, Kairon, Leucis, Melech,

Mordai, M orthos, Pelaios, Skam os, Therai

Female Infernal Names: Akta, Anakis, Bryseis, Criella,

Damaia, Ea, Kallista, Lerissa, Makaria, Nemeia,

Orianna, Phelaia, Rieta

“Virtue” Names: Art, Carrion, Chant, Creed, Despair,

Excellence, Fear, Glory, Hope, Ideal, Music, Nowhere,

Open, Poetry, Quest, Random, Reverence, Sorrow,

Temerity, Torment, W eary

### Mutual Mistrust

People tend to be suspicious of tieflings, assuming that

the ir infernal heritage has left its mark on the ir personality

and morality, not just the ir appearance.

Shopkeepers keep

a close eye on the ir goods when tieflings enter the ir stores,

the town watch might follow a tiefling around for a while,

and demagogues blame tieflings for strange happenings.

The reality, though, is that a tiefling’s bloodline doesn’t affect

his or her personality to any great degree.

Years of dealing

with mistrust does leave its mark on most tieflings, and the y

respond to it in different ways.

Some choose to live up to the

wicked stereotype, but others are virtuous.

Most are simply

very aware of how people respond to the m.

After dealing with

this mistrust throughout you th, a tiefling often develops the

ability to overcome prejudice through charm or intimidation.

### Tiefling Traits

Tieflings share certain racial traits as a result of the ir

infernal descent.

Ability Score Increase.

Your Intelligence score

increases by 1, and you r Charisma score increases by 2.

Age.

Tieflings mature at the same rate as humans but

live a few years longer.

Alignment.

Tieflings might not have an innate

tendency toward evil, but many of the m end up the re.

Evil or not, an independent nature inclines many

tieflings toward a chaotic alignment.

Size.

Tieflings are about the sam e size and build as

humans.

Your size is Medium.

Speed.

Your base walking speed is 30 feet.

Darkvision.

Thanks to you r infernal heritage, you

have superior vision in dark and dim conditions.

You

can see in dim light with in 60 feet of you as if it were

bright light, and in darkness as if it w ere dim light.

You

can’t discern color in darkness, only shades ofgray.

Hellish Resistance.

You have resistance

to fire damage.

Infernal Legacy.

You know the thaumaturgy cantrip.

Once you reach 3rd level, you can cast the hellish

rebuke spell once per day as a 2nd-level spell.

Once you

reach 5th level, you can also cast the darkness spell

once per day.

Charisma is you r spellcasting ability for

the se spells.

Languages.

You can speak, read, and write Com m on

and Infernal.

## 3. C Lasses

ADVENTURERS ARE EXTRAORDINARY PEOPLE,

driven by a thirst for excitement into a

life that others w ould never dare lead.

They are heroes, com pelled to explore the

dark places of the world and take on the

challenges that lesser w om en and men

can’t stand against.

Class is the primary definition of what you r character

can do.

It’smore than a profession; it’s you r character’s

calling.

Class shapes the way you think about the

world and interact with it and you r relationship with

other people and powers in the multiverse.

A fighter,

for example, might view the world in pragmatic terms

of strategy and maneuvering, and see herself as just a

pawn in a much larger game.

A cleric, by contrast, might

see him self as a will ing servant in a god’s unfolding plan

or a conflict brewing am ong various deities.

W hile the

fighter has contacts in amercenary com pany or army,

the cleric might know a number of priests, paladins, and

devotees w ho share his faith.

Your class gives you a variety of special features, such

as a fighter’s mastery of w eapons and armor, and a

wizard’s spells.

At low levels, you r class gives you only

two or three features, but as you advance in level you

gain m ore and you r existing features often improve.

Each class entry in this chapter includes a table

summ arizing the benefits you gain at every level, and

a detailed explanation of each one.

Adventurers som etim es advance in m ore than one

class.

A rogue might switch direction in life and swear

the oath of a paladin.

A barbarian might discover latent

magical ability and dabble in the sorcerer class while

continuing to advance as a barbarian.

Elves are known

to com bine martial mastery with m agical training

and advance as fighters and w izards simultaneously.

Optional rules for com bining classes in this way, called

multiclassing, appear in chapter 6.

Twelve classes—listed in the Classes table—are found

in almost every D&D world and define the spectrum of

typical adventurers.

A tall human tribesman strides through a blizzard,

draped in fur and hefting his axe.

He laughs as he

charges toward the frost giant w ho dared poach his

people’s elk herd.

A half-orc snarls at the latest challenger to her

authority over the ir savage tribe, ready to break his neck

with her bare hands as she did to the last six rivals.

Frothing at the mouth, a dwarf slam s his helmet into

the face of his drow foe, the n turns to drive his armored

elbow into the gut ofanother.

These barbarians, different as the y might be, are

defined by the ir rage: unbridled, unquenchable, and

unthinking fury.

More than a mere emotion, the ir anger

is the ferocity of a cornered predator, the unrelenting

assault of a storm, the churning turmoil ofthe sea.

For som e, the ir rage springs from a com m union

with fierce animal spirits.

Others draw from a roiling

reservoir of anger at a world full of pain.

For every

barbarian, rage is a power that fuels not just a battle

frenzy but also uncanny reflexes, resilience, and

feats of strength.

People of towns and cities take pride in how the ir

civilized ways set the m apart from animals, as if

denying one’s ow n nature was a mark of superiority.

To

a barbarian, though, civilization is no virtue, but a sign

of weakness.

The strong em brace the ir animal nature-

keen instincts, primal physicality, and ferocious rage.

Barbarians are uncom fortable when hedged in by walls

and crowds.

They thrive in the wilds oftheir homelands:

the tundra, jungle, or grasslands where the ir tribes

live and hunt.

Barbarians com e alive in the chaos of combat.

They can enter a berserk state where rage takes over,

giving the m superhuman strength and resilience.

A

barbarian can draw on this reservoir of fury only a few

times with out resting, but those few rages are usually

sufficient to defeat what ever threats arise.

ALi feo fDa nge r

Not every m em ber of the tribes deem ed “barbarians”

by scions of civilized society has the barbarian class.

A

true barbarian am ong the se people is as uncom m on as

a skilled fighter in a town, and he or she plays a similar

role as a protector of the people and a leader in times

of war.

Life in the wild places of the world is fraught

with peril: rival tribes, deadly weather, and terrifying

monsters.

Barbarians charge headlong into that danger

so that the ir people don’t have to.

Their courage in the face of danger makes barbarians

perfectly suited for adventuring.

W and ering is often a

way of life for the ir native tribes, and the rootless life of

the adventurer is little hardship for a barbarian.

Som e

barbarians m iss the close-knit family structures of the

tribe, but eventually find the m replaced by the bonds

formed among the mem bers of the ir adventuring parties.

### Creatinga Barbarian

W hen creating a barbarian character, think about where

you r character com es from and his or her place in the

world.

Talk with you r DM about an appropriate origin

for you r barbarian.

Did you com e from a distant land,

making you a stranger in the area of the campaign?

Or is the campaign set in a rough-and-tumble frontier

where barbarians are com m on?

What led you to take up the adventuring life?

W ere you

lured to settled lands by the prom ise of riches?

Did you

join forces with soldiers of those lands to face a shared

threat?

Did monsters or an invading horde drive you

out of you r homeland, making you a rootless refugee?

Perhaps you were a prisoner of war, brought in chains to

“civilized” lands and only now able to win you r freedom.

Or you might have been cast out from you r people

because of a crim e you committed, a taboo you violated,

or a coup that removed you from a position of authority.

### Quick Build

You can make a barbarian quickly by following the se

suggestions.

First, put you r highest ability score in

Strength, followed by Constitution.

Second, choose the

outlander background.

C lass Fea tur e s

As a barbarian, you gain the following class features.

### Hit Points

## Equipment

### Rage

You s ta rtw ith th e fo llo w in geq u ip men t, in add itio n to

th eeq u ip men tgr ante dby you rba ckg ro und :

• (a) a greataxe or (b) any martial melee weapon

• (a) two handaxes or (b) any simple weapon

• An explorer’s pack and four javelins

In battle, you fight with primal ferocity.

On you r turn,

you can enter a rage as a bonus action.

W hile raging, you gain the following benefits if you

aren’twearing heavy armor:

• You have advantage on Strength checks and Strength

saving throws.

• When you make a melee weapon attack using

Strength, you gain a bonus to the damage roll that

increases as you gain levels as a barbarian, as shown

in the Rage Damage colum n of the Barbarian table.

• You have resistance to bludgeoning, piercing, and

slashing damage.

If you are able to cast spells, you can’t cast the m or

concentrate on the m while raging.

Your rage lasts for 1 minute.

It ends early if you are

knocked unconscious or if you r turn ends and you

have n’t attacked a hostile creature since you r last turn

or taken damage since the n.

You can also end you r rage

on you r turn as a bonus action.

Once you have raged the number of times shown

for you r barbarian level in the Rages colum n of the

Barbarian table, you must finish a long rest before you

can rage again.

### Unarmored Defense

W hile you are not wearing any armor, you r Arm or Class

equals 10 + you r Dexterity m odifier + you r Constitution

modifier.

You can use a shield and still gain this benefit.

### Reckless Attack

Starting at 2nd level, you can throw aside all concern

for defense to attack with fierce desperation.

W hen

you make you r first attack on you r turn, you can decide

to attack recklessly.

Doing so gives you advantage on

melee weapon attack rolls using Strength during this

turn, but attack rolls against you have advantage until

you r next turn.

### Danger Sense

At 2nd level, you gain an uncanny sense of when things

nearby aren’t as the y should be, giving you an edge

when you dodge away from danger.

You have advantage on Dexterity saving throws

against effects that you can see, such as traps and spells.

To gain this benefit, you can’t be blinded, deafened, or

incapacitated.

### Primal Path

At 3rd level, you choose a path that shapes the nature of

you r rage.

C hoose the Path of the Berserker or the Path

of the Totem Warrior, both detailed at the end of the

class description.

Your choice grants you features at 3rd

level and again at 6th, 10th, and 14th levels.

Beginning at 15th level, you r rage is so fierce that

it ends early only if you fall unconscious or if you

choose to end it.

### Indomitable Might

Beginning at 18th level, if you r total for a Strength

check is less than you r Strength score, you can use that

score in place of the total.

### Primal Champion

At 20th level, you em body the power of the wilds.

Your

Strength and Constitution scores increase by 4.

Your

maximum for those scores is now 24.

Pr ima l Pa ths

Rage burns in every barbarian’s heart, a furnace

that drives him or her toward greatness.

Different

### Ability Score Improvement

W hen you reach 4th level, and again at 8th, 12th, 16th,

and 19th level, you can increase one ability score of you r

choice by 2, or you can increase two ability scores of

you r choice by 1.

As normal, you can’t increase an ability

score above 20 using this feature.

### Extra Attack

Beginning at 5th level, you can attack twice, instead of

once, when ever you take the Attack action on you r turn.

### Fast Movement

Starting at 5th level, you r speed increases by 10 feet

while you aren’twearing heavy armor.

### Feral Instinct

By 7th level, you r instincts are so honed that you have

advantage on initiative rolls.

Additionally, if you are surprised at the beginning of

combat and aren’t incapacitated, you can act normally

on you r first turn, but only if you enter you r rage before

doing anything else on that turn.

### Brutal Critical

Beginning at 9th level, you can roll one additional

weapon damage die when determining the extra

damage for a critical hit with a melee attack.

This increases to two additional dice at 13th level

and three additional dice at 17th level.

### Relentless Rage

Starting at 11th level, you r rage can keep you fighting

despite grievous w ounds.

If you drop to 0 hit points

while you’re raging and don’t die outright, you can make

a DC 10 Constitution saving throw.

If you succeed, you

drop to 1 hit point instead.

Each time you use this feature after the first, the DC

increases by 5.

W hen you finish a short or long rest, the

DC resets to 10.

barbarians attribute the ir rage to different sources,

however.

For som e, it is an internal reservoir where

pain, grief, and anger are forged into a fury hard as

steel.

Others see it as a spiritual blessing, a gift of

a totem animal.

### Pathofthe Berserker

For som e barbarians, rage is a means to an end-—that

end being violence.

The Path of the Berserker is a path

of untrammeled fury, slick with blood.

As you enter

the berserker’s rage, you thrill in the chaos of battle,

heedless of you r own health or well-being.

### Frenzy

Starting when you choose this path at 3rd level, you

can go into a frenzy when you rage.

If you do so, for

the duration of you r rage you can make a single melee

weapon attack as a bonus action on each of you r turns

after this one.

W hen you r rage ends, you suffer one level

of exhaustion (as described in appendix A).

### Mindless Rage

Beginning at 6th level, you can’t be charm ed or

frightened while raging.

If you are charm ed or

frightened when you enter you r rage, the effect is

suspended for the duration of the rage.

### Intimidating Presence

Beginning at 10th level, you can use you r action to

frighten som eone with you r menacing presence.

W hen you do so, choose one creature that you can see

with in 30 feet of you.

If the creature can see or hear

you, it must succeed on aWisdom saving throw (DC

equal to 8 + you r proficiency bonus + you r Charisma

modifier) or be frightened of you until the end of you r

next turn.

On subsequent turns, you can use you r action

to extend the duration of this effect on the frightened

### Persistent Rage

creature until the end of you r next turn.

This effect ends

if the creature ends its turn out of line of sight or m ore

than 60 feet away from you.

If the creature succeeds on its saving throw, you can't

use this feature on that creature again for 24 hours.

### Retaliation

Starting at 14th level, when you take damage from

a creature that is with in 5 feet of you. you can use

you r reaction to make a melee weapon attack against

that creature.

### Pathofthe Totem Warrior

The Path of the Totem W arrior is a spiritual journey, as

the barbarian accepts a spirit animal as guide, protector,

and inspiration.

In battle, you r totem spirit fills you

with supernatural might, adding magical fuel to you r

barbarian rage.

Most barbarian tribes consider a totem animal to be

kin to a particular clan.

In such cases, it is unusual for

an individual to have more than one totem animal spirit,

though exceptions exist.

### Spirit Seeker

Yours is a path that seeks attunement with the natural

world, giving you a kinship with beasts.

At 3rd level when

you adopt this path, you gain the ability to cast the beast

sense and speak with animals spells, but only as rituals,

as described in chapter 10.

### Totem Spirit

At 3rd level, when you adopt this path, you choose a

totem spirit and gain its feature.

You must make or

acquire a physical totem object- an amulet or similar

adornment—that incorporates fur or feathers, claws,

teeth, or bones of the totem animal.

At you r option, you

also gain minor physical attributes that are reminiscent

of you r totem spirit.

For example, if you have a bear

totem spirit, you might be unusually hairy and thick-

skinned, or if you r totem is the eagle, you r eyes turn

bright yellow.

Your totem animal might be an animal related to those

listed here but m ore appropriate to you r homeland.

For example, you could choose a hawk or vulture in

place ofan eagle.

Bear.

W hile raging, you have resistance to all damage

except psychic damage.

The spirit of the bear makes you

tough enough to stand up to any punishment.

Eagle.

W hile you're raging and aren’t wearing

heavy armor, other creatures have disadvantage on

opportunity attack rolls against you, and you can use the

nothing else is holding you aloft.

W hile you’re raging, you can use a bonus action

on you r turn to knock a Large or smaller creature prone

when you hit it with melee weapon attack.

In the worlds of D&D, w ords and music are

not just vibrations of air, but vocalizations with

power all the ir own.

The bard is a master of song,

speech, and the m agic the y contain.

Bards say

that the multiverse w as spoken into existence, that the

words ofthe gods gave it shape, and that echoes of the se

primordial W ords ofCreation still resound throughout

the cosm os.

The music of bards is an attempt to snatch

and harness those echoes, subtly woven into the ir

spells and powers.

The greatest strength of bards is the ir sheer

versatility.

Many bards prefer to stick to the sidelines

in combat, using the ir magic to inspire the ir allies and

hinder the ir foes from a distance.

But bards are capable

of defending the mselves in melee if necessary, using

the ir m agic to bolster the ir sw ords and armor.

Their

spells lean toward charm s and illusions rather than

blatantly destructive spells.

They have a wide-ranging

knowledge of many subjects and a natural aptitude

that lets the m do almost anything well.

Bards becom e

masters of the talents the y set the ir minds to perfecting,

from musical perform ance to esoteric knowledge.

### Learningfrom Experience

True bards are not com m on in the world.

Not every

minstrel singing in a tavern or jester cavorting in a royal

court is a bard.

Discovering the magic hidden in music

requires hard study and som e measure of natural talent

that most troubadours and jongleurs lack.

It can be hard

to spot the difference between the se perform ers and true

bards, though.

A bard’s life is spent wandering across

the land gathering lore, telling stories, and living on the

gratitude of audiences, much like any other entertainer.

But a depth of knowledge, a level of musical skill, and a

touch of magic set bards apart from the ir fellows.

Only rarely do bards settle in one place for long, and

the ir natural desire to travel—to find new tales to tell,

new skills to learn, and new discoveries beyond the

horizon—makes an adventuring career a natural calling.

Every adventure is an opportunity to learn, practice a

variety of skills, enter long-forgotten tombs, discover lost

Ba r d

Humming as she traces her fingers over an ancient

monument in a long-forgotten ruin, a half-elf in rugged

leathers finds knowledge springing into her mind,

conjured forth by the magic of her song—knowledge

of the people who constructed the monument and the

mythic saga it depicts.

A stern human warrior bangs his sword rhythmically

against his scale mail, setting the tempo for his war chant

and exhorting his com panions to bravery and heroism.

The magic of his song fortifies and em boldens the m.

Laughing as she tunes her cittern, a gnom e weaves

her subtle magic over the assem bled nobles, ensuring

that her com panions’ words will be well received.

W hether scholar, skald, or scoundrel, a bard weaves

magic through w ords and music to inspire allies,

dem oralize foes, manipulate minds, create

illusions, and even heal wounds.

### Musicand Magic

works of magic, decipher old tomes, travel to strange

places, or encounter exotic creatures.

Bards love to

accom pany heroes to witness the ir deeds firsthand.

A

bard who can tell an awe-inspiring story from personal

experience earns renown am ong other bards.

Indeed,

after telling so many stories about heroes accom plishing

mighty deeds, many bards take the se the mes to heart

and assume heroic roles the mselves.

### Proficiencies

Armor: Light armor

Weapons: Simple weapons, hand crossbow s,

longswords, rapiers, shortswords

Tools: Three musical instruments of you r choice

Saving Throws: Dexterity, Charisma

Skills: Choose any three

### Creatinga Bard

Bards thrive on stories, whether those stories are true

or not.

Your character’s background and motivations

are not as important as the stories that he or she tells

about the m.

Perhaps you had a secure and mundane

childhood.

There’s no good story to be told about that,

so you might paint you rself as an orphan raised by a hag

in a dismal swamp.

Or you r childhood might be worthy

of a story.

Som e bards acquire the ir magical music

through extraordinary means, including the inspiration

of fey or other supernatural creatures.

Did you serve an apprenticeship, studying under a

master, following the m ore experienced bard until you

were ready to strike out on you r own?

Or did you attend

a college where you studied bardic lore and practiced

you r musical magic?

Perhaps you were a you ng runaway

or orphan, befriended by a wandering bard w ho becam e

you r mentor.

Or you might have been a spoiled noble

child tutored by a master.

Perhaps you stumbled into the

clutches of a hag, making a bargain for a musical gift in

addition to you r life and freedom, but at what cost?

## Equipment

You start with the following equipment, in addition to

the equipment granted by you r background:

• (a) a rapier, (b) a longsword, or (c) any simple weapon

• (a) a diplomat’s pack or (b) an entertainer's pack

• (a) a lute or (b) any other musical instrument

• Leather armor and a dagger

## Spellcasting

### Cantrips

You have learned to untangle and reshape the fabric of

reality in harmony with you r wishes and music.

Your

spells are part of you r vast repertoire, magic that you

can tune to different situations.

S ee chapter 10 for the

general rules of spellcasting and chapter 11 for the

bard spell list.

You know two cantrips of you r choice from the bard

spell list.

You learn additional bard cantrips of you r

choice at higher levels, as shown in the Cantrips Known

colum n of the Bard table.

C lass Fea tur e s

As a bard, you gain the following class features.

### Hit Points

Hit Dice: 1d8 per bard level

Hit Points at 1st Level: 8 + you r Constitution modifier

Hit Points at Higher Levels: 1d8 (or 5) + you r

Constitution modifier per bard level after 1st

### Quick Build

You can make a bard quickly by

following the se suggestions.

First,

Charisma should be you r highest

ability score, followed by Dexterity.

Second, choose the entertainer

background.

Third, choose the dancing lights and

vicious mockery cantrips, along with the following

1st-level spells: charm person, detect magic, healing

word, and thunderwave.

### Spell Slots

The Bard table shows how many spell slots you have to

cast you r spells of 1st level and higher.

To cast one of

the se spells, you must expend a slot of the spell’s level

or higher.

You regain all expended spell slots when you

finish a long rest.

For example, if you know the 1st-level spell cure

wounds and have a 1st-level and a 2nd-level spell slot

available, you can cast cure wounds using either slot.

Spe lls Kno wno f 1s tLe vel and Hig her

You know four 1st-level spells of you r choice from the

bard spell list.

The Spells Known colum n of the Bard table shows

when you learn m ore bard spells of you r choice.

Each of

the se spells must be of a level for which you have spell

slots, as shown on the table.

For instance, when you

reach 3rd level in this class, you can learn one new spell

of 1st or 2nd level.

Additionally, when you gain a level in this class, you

can choose one of the bard spells you know and replace

it with another spell from the bard spell list, which also

must be of a level for which you have spell slots.

### Spellcasting Ability

Charisma is you r spellcasting ability for you r bard

spells.

Your magic com es from the heart and soul you

pour into the perform ance of you r music or oration.

You use you r Charisma when ever a spell refers to you r

spellcasting ability.

In addition, you use you r Charisma

modifier when setting the saving throw DC for a bard

spell you cast and when making an attack roll with one.

Spell save DC = 8 + you r proficiency bonus +

you r Charisma modifier

Spell attack modifier = you r proficiency bonus +

you r Charisma modifier

### Ritual Casting

You can cast any bard spell you know as a ritual if that

spell has the ritual tag.

### Spellcasting Focus

You can use a musical instrument (found in chapter 5)

as a spellcasting focus for you r bard spells.

### Bardic Inspiration

You can inspire others through stirring w ords or music.

To do so, you use a bonus action on you r turn to choose

one creature other than you rself with in 60 feet of you

who can hear you.

That creature gains one Bardic

Inspiration die, a d6.

Once with in the next 10 minutes, the creature can roll

the die and add the number rolled to one ability check,

attack roll, or saving throw it makes.

The creature can

wait until after it rolls the d20 before deciding to use the

Bardic Inspiration die, but must decide before the DM

says whether the roll succeeds or fails.

Once the Bardic

Inspiration die is rolled, it is lost.

A creature can have

only one Bardic Inspiration die at a time.

You can use this feature a number of times equal

to you r Charisma modifier (a minimum of once).

You

regain any expended uses when you finish a long rest.

certain levels in this class.

The die becom es a d8 at 5th

level, a d 10 at 10th level, and adl2 at 15th level.

### Jackof All Trades

Starting at 2nd level, you can add half you r proficiency

bonus, rounded down, to any ability check you make that

doesn’t already include you r proficiency bonus.

### Songof Rest

Beginning at 2nd level, you can use soothing music or

oration to help revitalize you r wounded allies during

a short rest.

If you or any friendly creatures w ho can

hear you r perform ance regain hit points at the end of

the short rest, each of those creatures regains an extra

1d6 hit points.

The extra hit points increase when you reach certain

levels in this class: to 1d8 at 9th level, to 1d 10 at 13th

level, and to 1d 12 at 17th level.

### Bard College

At 3rd level, you delve into the advanced techniques of

a bard college of you r choice: the College of Lore or the

College of Valor, both detailed at the end of the class

description.

Your choice grants you features at 3rd level

and again at 6th and 14th level.

### Expertise

At 3rd level, choose two of you r skill proficiencies.

Your

proficiency bonus is doubled for any ability check you

make that uses either of the chosen proficiencies.

At 10th level, you can choose another two skill

proficiencies to gain this benefit.

### Ability Score Improvement

W hen you reach 4th level, and again at 8th, 12th, 16th,

and 19th level, you can increase one ability score of you r

choice by 2, or you can increase two ability scores of

you r choice by 1.

As normal, you can’t increase an ability

score above 20 using this feature.

### Fontof Inspiration

Beginning when you reach 5th level, you regain all of

you r expended uses of Bardic Inspiration when you

finish a short or long rest.

### Countercharm

At 6th level, you gain the ability to use musical notes or

words of power to disrupt mind-influencing effects.

As

an action, you can start a perform ance that lasts until

the end of you r next turn.

During that time, you and any

friendly creatures with in 30 feet of you have advantage

on saving throws against being frightened or charmed.

A creature must be able to hear you to gain this benefit.

The perform ance ends early if you are incapacitated or

silenced or if you voluntarily end it (no action required).

### Magical Secrets

By 10th level, you have plundered magical knowledge

from a wide spectrum of disciplines.

C hoose two spells

from any class, including this one.

A spell you choose

must be of a level you can cast, as shown on the Bard

table, or a cantrip.

The chosen spells count as bard spells for you and are

included in the number in the Spells Known colum n of

the Bard table.

You learn two additional spells from any class at 14th

level and again at 18th level.

### Superior Inspiration

At 20th level, when you roll initiative and have no uses

of Bardic Inspiration left, you regain one use.

Ba rdC o ll ege s

The way of a bard is gregarious.

Bards seek each

other out to swap songs and stories, boast oftheir

accomplishments, and share the ir knowledge.

Bards

form loose associations, which the y call colleges, to

facilitate the ir gatherings and preserve the ir traditions.

### Collegeof Lore

Bards of the College ofLore know som ething about

m ost things, collecting bits of knowledge from sources

as diverse as scholarly tom es and peasant tales.

W hether singing folk ballads in taverns or elaborate

com positions in royal courts, the se bards use the ir gifts

to hold audiences spellbound.

W hen the applause dies

down, the audience m em bers might find the mselves

questioning everything the y held to be true, from the ir

faith in the priesthood of the local temple to the ir

loyalty to the king.

The loyalty of the se bards lies in the pursuit of beauty

and truth, not in fealty to amonarch or following the

tenets of a deity.

A noble who keeps such a bard as a

herald or advisor knows that the bard w ould rather be

honest than politic.

The college’smem bers gather in libraries and

som etim es in actual colleges, complete with classroom s

and dormitories, to share the ir lore with one another.

They also meet at festivals or affairs of state, where the y

can expose corruption, unravel lies, and poke fun at self-

important figures of authority.

### Bonus Proficiencies

W hen you join the College of Lore at 3rd level, you gain

proficiency with three skills ofyour choice.

### Cutting Words

Also at 3rd level, you learn how to use you r wit to

distract, confuse, and otherwise sap the confidence and

com petence of others.

W hen a creature that you can

see with in 60 feet of you makes an attack roll, an ability

check, or a damage roll, you can use you r reaction to

expend one of you r uses of Bardic Inspiration, rolling

a Bardic Inspiration die and subtracting the number

rolled from the creature’s roll.

You can choose to use

this feature after the creature makes its roll, but before

the DM determines whether the attack roll or ability

check succeeds or fails, or before the creature deals its

damage.

The creature is immune if it can’t hear you or if

it’s immune to being charmed.

### Additional Magical Secrets

At 6th level, you learn two spells of you r choice from any

class.

A spell you choose must be of a level you can cast,

as shown on the Bard table, or a cantrip.

The chosen

spells count as bard spells for you but don’t count

against the number of bard spells you know.

### Peerless Skill

Starting at 14th level, when you make an ability check,

you can expend one use of Bardic Inspiration.

Roll a

Bardic Inspiration die and add the number rolled to

you r ability check.

You can choose to do so after you roil

the die for the ability check, but before the DM tells you

whether you succeed or fail.

### Collegeof Valor

Bards of the College of Valor are daring skalds whose

tales keep alive the m em ory of the great heroes of the

past, and the reby inspire a new generation of heroes.

These bards gather in mead halls or around great

bonfires to sing the deeds of the mighty, both past

and present.

They travel the land to witness great

events firsthand and to ensure that the m em ory of

those events doesn’t pass from the world.

With the ir

songs, the y inspire others to reach the same heights of

accomplishment as the heroes of old.

### Bonus Proficiencies

When you join the College of Valor at 3rd level, you

gain proficiency with medium armor, shields, and

martial weapons.

### Combat Inspiration

Also at 3rd level, you learn to inspire others in battle.

A creature that has a Bardic Inspiration die from you

can roll that die and add the number rolled to a weapon

damage roll it just made.

Alternatively, when an attack

roll is made against the creature, it can use its reaction

to roll the Bardic Inspiration die and add the number

rolled to its AC against that attack, after seeing the roll

but before knowing whether it hits or m isses.

### Extra Attack

Starting at 6th level, you can attack twice, instead of

once, when ever you take the Attack action on you r turn.

### Battle Magic

At 14th level, you have mastered the art of weaving

spellcasting and weapon use into a single harm onious

act.

W hen you use you r action to cast a bard spell, you

can make one weapon attack as a bonus action.

Arm s and eyes upraised toward the sun and a prayer

on his lips, an elf begins to glow with an inner light that

spills out to heal his battle-worn com panions.

Chanting a song of glory, a dwarf swings his axe

in wide swaths to cut through the ranks of orcs

arrayed against him, shouting praise to the gods with

every foe’s fall.

Calling down a curse upon the forces of undeath, a

human lifts her holy symbol as light pours from it to

drive back the zom bies crowding in on her com panions.

Clerics are intermediaries between the mortal world

and the distant planes of the gods.

As varied as the gods

the y serve, clerics strive to em body the handiwork of

the ir deities.

No ordinary priest, a cleric is imbued with

divine magic.

### Healersand Warriors

Divine magic, as the name suggests, is the power of

the gods, flowing from the m into the world.

Clerics are

conduits for that power, manifesting it as miraculous

effects.

The gods don’t grant this power to everyone who

seeks it, but only to those chosen to fulfill a high calling.

Harnessing divine magic doesn’t rely on study or

training.

A cleric might learn formulaic prayers and

ancient rites, but the ability to cast cleric spells relies on

devotion and an intuitive sense ofa deity’s wishes.

Clerics com bine the helpful magic ofhealing and

inspiring the ir allies with spells that harm and hinder

foes.

They can provoke awe and dread, lay curses of

plague or poison, and even call down flames from heaven

to consum e the ir enemies.

For those evildoers who will

benefit most from amace to the head, clerics depend on

the ir com bat training to let the m wade into melee with

the power of the gods on the ir side.

### Divine Agents

Not every acolyte or officiant at a temple or shrine is a

cleric.

Som e priests are called to a simple life oftemple

service, carrying out the ir gods’ will through prayer and

sacrifice, not by m agic and strength ofarms.

In som e

cities, priesthood amounts to a political office, viewed

as a stepping stone to higher positions ofauthority and

involving no com m union with a god at all.

True clerics

are rare in most hierarchies.

W hen a cleric takes up an adventuring life, it is usually

because his or her god demands it.

Pursuing the goals

of the gods often involves braving dangers beyond the

walls of civilization, smiting evil or seeking holy relics in

ancient tombs.

Many clerics are also expected to protect

the ir deities’ worshipers, which can mean fighting

rampaging orc s, negotiating peace between warring

nations, or sealing a portal that w ould allow a demon

prince to enter the world.

M ost adventuring clerics maintain som e connection to

established temples and orders of the ir faiths.

A temple

might ask for a cleric’s aid, or a high priest might be in a

position to demand it.

### Creatinga Cleric

As you create a cleric, the m ost important question to

consider is which deity to serve and what principles you

want you r character to embody.

Appendix B includes

lists of many of the gods of the multiverse.

Check with

you r DM to learn which deities are in you r campaign.

Once you’ve chosen a deity, consider you r cleric's

relationship to that god.

Did you enter this service

will ingly?

Or did the god choose you, impelling you into

service with no regard for you r wishes?

H ow do the

temple priests of you r faith regard you: as a champion

or a troublemaker?

W hat are you r ultimate goals?

D oes

you r deity have a special task in mind for you?

Or are

you striving to prove you rself worthy of a great quest?

### Quick Build

You can make a cleric quickly by following the se

suggestions.

First, W isdom should be you r highest

ability score, followed by Strength or Constitution.

Second, choose the acolyte background.

C lass Fea tur e s

As a cleric, you gain the following class features.

### Hit Points

Hit Dice: 1d8 per cleric level

Hit Points at 1st Level: 8 + you r Constitution modifier

Hit Points at Higher Levels: 1d8 (or 5) + you r

Constitution m odifier per cleric level after 1st

## Spellcasting

### Cantrips

As a conduit for divine power, you can cast cleric spells.

See chapter 10 for the general rules of spellcasting and

chapter 11 for the cleric spell list.

At 1st level, you know three cantrips ofyour choice from

the cleric spell list.

You learn additional cleric cantrips

of you r choice at higher levels, as shown in the Cantrips

Known colum n of the Cleric table.

### Preparingand Casting Spells

The Cleric table shows how many spell slots you have

to cast you r spells o f 1st level and higher.

To cast one of

the se spells, you must expend a slot of the spell’s level

or higher.

You regain all expended spell slots when you

finish a long rest.

You prepare the list of cleric spells that are available

for you to cast, choosing from the cleric spell list.

W hen

you do so, choose a number of cleric spells equal to

you r W isdom modifier + you r cleric level (minimum of

one spell).

The spells must be of a level for which you

have spell slots.

For example, if you are a 3rd-level cleric, you have four

1st-level and two 2nd-level spell slots.

With aWisdom

of 16, you r list of prepared spells can include six spells

of 1st or 2nd level, in any combination.

If you prepare

the 1st-level spell cure wounds, you can cast it using

a 1st-level or 2nd-level slot.

Casting the spell doesn’t

remove it from you r list of prepared spells.

You can change you r list of prepared spells when you

finish a long rest.

Preparing a new list ofcleric spells

requires time spent in prayer and meditation: at least 1

minute per spell level for each spell on you r list.

### Spellcasting Ability

W isdom is you r spellcasting ability for you r cleric spells.

The power of you r spells com es from you r devotion to

you r deity.

You use you r W isdom when ever a cleric spell

refers to you r spellcasting ability.

In addition, you use

you r W isdom m odifier when setting the saving throw

DC for a cleric spell you cast and when making an

attack roll with one.

Spell save DC = 8 + you r proficiency bonus +

you r Wisdom modifier

Spell attack modifier = you r proficiency bonus +

you r Wisdom modifier

### Ritual Casting

You can cast a cleric spell as a ritual if that spell has the

ritual tag and you have the spell prepared.

### Spellcasting Focus

You can use a holy sym bol (found in chapter 5) as a

spellcasting focus for you r cleric spells.

### Divine Domain

Choose one domain related to you r deity: Knowledge,

Life, Light, Nature, Tempest, Trickery, or War.

Each

dom ain is detailed at the end of the class description,

and each one provides examples of gods associated

with it.

Your choice grants you dom ain spells and other

features when you choose it at 1st level.

It also grants

you additional ways to use Channel Divinity when you

gain that feature at 2nd level, and additional benefits at

6th, 8th, and 17th levels.

### Domain Spells

Each dom ain has a list of spells—its dom ain spells—

that you gain at the cleric levels noted in the domain

description.

Once you gain a dom ain spell, you always

have it prepared, and it doesn’t count against the

number of spells you can prepare each day.

If you have a dom ain spell that doesn’t appear on the

cleric spell list, the spell is nonetheless a cleric spell for you.

### Channel Divinity

At 2nd level, you gain the ability to channel divine

energy directly from you r deity, using that energy to fuel

magical effects.

You start with two such effects: Turn

Undead and an effect determined by you r domain.

Som e

dom ains grant you additional effects as you advance in

levels, as noted in the dom ain description.

W hen you use you r Channel Divinity, you choose

which effect to create.

You must the n finish a short or

long rest to use you r Channel Divinity again.

S om e Channel Divinity effects require saving throws.

W hen you use such an effect from this class, the DC

equals you r cleric spell save DC.

Beginning at 6th level, you can use you r Channel

Divinity twice between rests, and beginning at 18th level.

you can use it three times between rests.

W hen you finish

a short or long rest, you regain you r expended uses.

Cha nne lDi vin ity : Tur nUn dea d

As an action, you present you r holy symbol and speak a

prayer censuring the undead.

Each undead that can see

or hear you with in 30 feet of you must make aWisdom

saving throw.

If the creature fails its saving throw, it is

turned for 1 minute or until it takes any damage.

A turned creature must spend its turns trying to move

as far away from you as it can, and it can’t will ingly

move to a space with in 30 feet of you.

It also can’t take

reactions.

For its action, it can use only the Dash action

or try to escape from an effect that prevents it from

moving.

If the re’s nowhere to move, the creature can use

the Dodge action.

### Ability Score Improvement

W hen you reach 4th level, and again at 8th, 12th, 16th,

and 19th level, you can increase one ability score of you r

choice by 2, or you can increase two ability scores of

you r choice by 1.

As normal, you can’t increase an ability

score above 20 using this feature.

### Destroy Undead

Starting at 5th level, when an undead fails its saving

throw against you r Turn Undead feature, the creature is

instantly destroyed if its challenge rating is at or below a

certain threshold, as shown in the Destroy Undead table.

### Destroy Undead

5th

8th

17th

### Divine Intervention

Beginning at 10th level, you can call on you r deity to

intervene on you r behalf when you r need is great.

Imploring you r deity’s aid requires you to use you r

action.

D escribe the assistance you seek, and roll

percentile dice.

If you roll a number equal to or lower

than you r cleric level, you r deity intervenes.

The DM

chooses the nature of the intervention; the effect of any

cleric spell or cleric dom ain spell w ould be appropriate.

If you r deity intervenes, you can’t use this feature

again for 7 days.

Otherwise, you can use it again after

you finish a long rest.

At 20th level, you r call for intervention succeeds

automatically, no roll required.

### Divine Domains

In a pantheon, every deity has influence over different

aspects of mortal life and civilization, called a deity’s

domain.

All the dom ains over which a deity has

influence are called the deity’s portfolio.

For example,

the portfolio of the Greek god Apollo includes the

dom ains of Knowledge, Life, and Light.

As a cleric, you

choose one aspect of you r deity’s portfolio to emphasize,

and you are granted powers related to that domain.

Your choice might correspond to a particular sect

dedicated to you r deity.

Apollo, for example, could be

worshiped in one region as Phoebus (“radiant”) Apollo,

emphasizing his influence over the Light domain,

and in a different place as Apollo Acesius (“healing”),

emphasizing his association with the Life domain.

Alternatively, you r choice of dom ain could simply be a

matter of personal preference, the aspect ofthe deity

that appeals to you most.

Each dom ain’s description gives examples of deities

w ho have influence over that domain.

G ods are included

from the worlds of the Forgotten Realms, Greyhawk,

Dragonlance, and Eberron campaign settings, as well as

from the Celtic, Greek, Norse, and Egyptian pantheons

ofantiquity.

### Knowledge Domain

The gods of knowledge—including Oghma, B occob,

Gilean, Aureon, and Thoth—value learning and

understanding above all.

Som e teach that knowledge is

to be gathered and shared in libraries and universities,

or promote the practical knowledge ofcraft and

invention.

Som e deities hoard knowledge and keep its

secrets to the mselves.

And som e prom ise the ir followers

that the y will gain tremendous pow er if the y unlock the

secrets ofthe multiverse.

Followers of the se gods study

esoteric lore, collect old tomes, delve into the secret

places of the earth, and learn all the y can.

of knowledge promote the practical knowledge of craft

and invention, including smith deities like Gond, Reorx,

Dru id

Holding high a gnarled staff wreathed with holly, an elf

sum m ons the fury of the storm and calls down explosive

bolts of lightning to smite the torch-carrying orc s who

threaten her forest.

Crouching out ofsight on a high tree branch in the

form of a leopard, a human peers out ofthe jungle at the

strange construction of a temple of Evil Elemental Air,

keeping a close eye on the cultists’ activities.

Swinging a blade form ed of pure fire, a half-elf

charges into amass ofskeletal soldiers, sundering

the unnatural magic that gives the foul creatures the

m ocking sem blance oflife.

W hether calling on the elemental forces of nature or

emulating the creatures of the animal world, druids are

an embodim ent of nature’s resilience, cunning, and fury.

They claim no mastery over nature.

Instead, the y see

the mselves as extensions ofnature’s indomitable will.

### Powerof Nature

Druids revere nature above all, gaining the ir spells and

other magical powers either from the force of nature

itself or from a nature deity.

Many druids pursue a

mystic spirituality oftranscendent union with nature

rather than devotion to a divine entity, while others

serve gods ofwild nature, animals, or elemental forces.

The ancient druidic traditions are som etim es called

the Old Faith, in contrast to the worship ofgods in

temples and shrines.

Druid spells are oriented toward nature and anim als—

the power of tooth and claw, of sun and m oon, of fire

and storm.

Druids also gain the ability to take on animal

forms, and som e druids make a particular study of this

practice, even to the point where the y prefer animal

form to the ir natural form.

### Preservethe Balance

For druids, nature exists in a precarious balance.

The

four elements that make up aworld—air, earth, fire,

and water—must remain in equilibrium.

If one element

were to gain power over the others, the world could be

destroyed, drawn into one of the elemental planes and

broken apart into its com ponent elements.

Thus, druids

oppose cults of Elemental Evil and others who promote

one element to the exclusion of others.

Druids are also concerned with the delicate ecological

balance that sustains plant and animal life, and the need

for civilized folk to live in harmony with nature, not in

opposition to it.

Druids accept that which is cruel in

nature, and the y hate that which is unnatural, including

aberrations (such as beholders and mind flayers)

and undead (such as zom bies and vampires).

Druids

som etim es lead raids against such creatures, especially

when the monsters encroach on the druids’ territory.

Druids are often found guarding sacred sites or

watching over regions of unspoiled nature.

But when a

significant danger arises, threatening nature’s balance

or the lands the y protect, druids take on amore active

role in com bating the threat, as adventurers.

### Creatinga Druid

W hen making a druid, consider why you r character has

such a close bond with nature.

Perhaps you r character

lives in a society where the Old Faith still thrives, or was

raised by a druid after being abandoned in the depths

of a forest.

Perhaps you r character had a dramatic

encounter with the spirits of nature, com ing face to

face with a giant eagle or dire w olf and surviving the

experience.

Maybe you r character w as born during an

epic storm or a volcanic eruption, which was interpreted

as a sign that becom ing a druid

was part of you r character’s destiny.

Have you always been an adventurer

as part of you r druidic calling, or did you

first spend time as a caretaker of a sacred

grove or spring?

Perhaps you r homeland was

befouled by evil, and you took up an adventuring life in

hopes of finding a new hom e or purpose.

### Quick Build

You can make a druid quickly by following the se

suggestions.

First, W isdom should be you r highest

ability score, followed by Constitution.

Second, choose

the hermit background.

C lass Fea tur e s

As a druid, you gain the following class features.

### Hit Points

Hit Dice: 1d8 per druid level

Skills: C hoose two from Arcana, Animal

Handling, Insight, Medicine, Nature, Perception,

Religion, and Survival

## Equipment

### Druidic

You start with the following equipment, in addition to

the equipment granted by you r background:

• (a) awooden shield or (b) any simple weapon

• (a) a scim itar or (b) any simple melee weapon

•

Leather armor, an explorer’s pack, and a druidic focus

You know Druidic, the secret language of druids.

You

can speak the language and use it to leave hidden

m essages.

You and others w ho know this language

automatically spot such a message.

Others spot the

m essage’s presence with a successful DC 15 W isdom

(Perception) check but can’t decipher it with out magic.

## Spellcasting

### Cantrips

Drawing on the divine essence of nature itself, you

can cast spells to shape that essence to you r will.

See

chapter 10 for the general rules ofspellcasting and

chapter 11 for the druid spell list.

At 1st level, you know two cantrips of you r choice from

the druid spell list.

You learn additional druid cantrips

ofyour choice at higher levels, as shown in the Cantrips

Known colum n of the Druid table.

### Preparingand Casting Spells

The Druid table show s how many spell slots you have

to cast you r spells of 1st level and higher.

To cast one of

the se druid spells, you must expend a slot of the spell’s

level or higher.

You regain all expended spell slots when

you finish a long rest.

You prepare the list of druid spells that are available

for you to cast, choosing from the druid spell list.

W hen

you do so, choose a number ofdruid spells equal to

you r W isdom m odifier + you r druid level (minimum of

### Sacred Plantsand Wood

A druid holds certain plants to be sacred, particularly alder,

ash, birch, elder, hazel, holly, juniper, mistletoe, oak, rowan,

will ow, and yew.

Druids often use such plants as part of a

spellcasting focus, incorporating lengths of oak or yew or

sprigs of mistletoe.

Similarly, a druid uses such woods to make other objects,

such as weapons and shields.

Yew is associated with death

and rebirth, so weapon handles for scimitars or sickles might

be fashioned from it.

Ash is associated with life and oak

with strength.

These woods make excellent hafts or whole

weapons, such as clubs or quarterstaffs, as well as shields.

Alder is associated with air, and it might be used for thrown

weapons, such as darts or javelins.

Druids from regions that lack the plants described here

have chosen other plants to take on similar uses.

For

instance, a druid of a desert region might value the yucca

tree and cactus plants.

one spell).

The spells must be of a level for which you

have spell slots.

For example, if you are a 3rd-level druid, you have four

1st-level and two 2nd-level spell slots.

With aWisdom

of 16, you r list of prepared spells can include six spells

of 1st or 2nd level, in any combination.

If you prepare

the 1st-level spell cure wounds, you can cast it using

a 1st-level or 2nd-level slot.

Casting the spell doesn’t

remove it from you r list of prepared spells.

You can also change you r list of prepared spells when

you finish a long rest.

Preparing a new list of druid

spells requires time spent in prayer and meditation: at

least 1 minute per spell level for each spell on you r list.

### Spellcasting Ability

W isdom is you r spellcasting ability for you r druid

spells, since you r m agic draws upon you r devotion and

attunement to nature.

You use you r W isdom when ever

a spell refers to you r spellcasting ability.

In addition,

you use you r W isdom modifier when setting the saving

throw DC for a druid spell you cast and when making an

attack roll with one.

Spell save DC = 8 + you r proficiency bonus +

you r Wisdom modifier

Spell attack modifier = you r proficiency bonus +

you r Wisdom modifier

### Ritual Casting

You can cast a druid spell as a ritual if that spell has the

ritual tag and you have the spell prepared.

### Spellcasting Focus

You can use a druidic focus (found in chapter 5) as a

spellcasting focus for you r druid spells.

### Wild Shape

Starting at 2nd level, you can use you r action to

magically assume the shape of a beast that you have

seen before.

You can use this feature twice.

You regain

expended uses when you finish a short or long rest.

Your druid level determines the beasts you can

transform into, as shown in the Beast Shapes table.

At

2nd level, for example, you can transform into any beast

that has a challenge rating of 1/4 or lower that doesn’t

have a flying or swim m ing speed.

Giant eagle

You can stay in a beast shape for a number ofhours

equal to half you r druid level (rounded down).

You the n

revert to you r normal form unless you expend another

use of this feature.

You can revert to you r normal

form earlier by using a bonus action on you r turn.

You

automatically revert if you fall unconscious, drop to

0 hit points, or die.

W hile you are transformed, the following rules apply:

• Your game statistics are replaced by the statistics of

the beast, but you retain you r alignment, personality,

and Intelligence, W isdom , and Charisma scores.

You

also retain all of you r skill and saving throw proficien-

cies, in addition to gaining those of the creature.

If

the creature has the same proficiency as you and the

bonus in its stat block is higher than you rs, use the

creature’s bonus instead of you rs.

If the creature has

any legendary or lair actions, you can't use the m.

• W hen you transform, you assume the beast’s hit

points and Hit Dice.

W hen you revert to you r normal

form, you return to the number of hit points you had

before you transformed.

However, if you revert as a

result of dropping to 0 hit points, any excess damage

carries over to you r normal form.

For example, if you

take 10 damage in animal form and have only 1 hit

point left, you revert and take 9 damage.

Aslong as

the excess damage doesn’t reduce you r normal form

to 0 hit points, you aren’t knocked unconscious.

• You can’t cast spells, and you r ability to speak or

take any action that requires hands is limited to the

capabilities of you r beast form.

Transforming doesn’t

break you r concentration on a spell you’ve already

cast, however, or prevent you from taking actions that

are part of a spell, such as call lightning, that you’ve

already cast.

• You retain the benefit of any features from you r class,

race, or other source and can use the m if the new

form is physically capable of doing so.

However, you

can’t use any ofyour special senses, such as darkvi-

sion, unless you r new form also has that sense.

• You choose whether you r equipment falls to the

ground in you r space, merges into you r new form, or

is worn by it.

W orn equipment functions as normal,

but the DM decides whether it is practical for the new

form to wear a piece of equipment, based on the crea-

ture’s shape and size.

Your equipment doesn’t change

size or shape to match the new

form, and any equipment that

the new form can’twear

must either fall to the

ground or merge with it.

Equipment that merges

with the form has no

effect until you leave

the form.

### Druid Circle

At 2nd level, you choose to

identify with a circle of druids:

the Circle of the Land or the Circle of the M oon, both

detailed at the end of the class description.

Your choice

grants you features at 2nd level and again at 6th, 10th,

and 14th level.

### Ability Score Improvement

W hen you reach 4th level, and again at 8th, 12th, 16th,

and 19th level, you can increase one ability score of

you r choice by 2, or you can increase two ability scores

of you r choice by 1.

As normal, you can’t increase an

ability score above 20 using this feature.

Starting at 18th level, the primal magic that you wield

causes you to age m ore slowly.

For every 10 years that

pass, you r body ages only 1 year.

### Beast Spells

Beginning at 18th level, you can cast many of you r druid

spells in any shape you assume using W ild Shape.

You

can perform the som atic and verbal com ponents of a

druid spell while in a beast shape, but you aren’t able to

provide material com ponents.

### Archdruid

At 20th level, you can use you r W ild Shape an unlimited

num ber of times.

### Timeless Body

Additionally, you can ignore the verbal and somatic

com ponents of you r druid spells, as well as any material

com ponents that lack a cost and aren’t consum ed by a

spell.

You gain this benefit in both you r normal shape

and you r beast shape from W ild Shape.

Dru id C ircles

Though the ir organization is invisible to most outsiders,

druids are part of a society that spans the land, ignoring

political borders.

All druids are nominally m em bers

of this druidic society, though som e individuals are so

isolated that the y have never seen any high-ranking

m em bers of the society or participated in druidic

gatherings.

Druids recognize each other as brothers and

sisters.

Like creatures of the wilderness, however, druids

som etim es compete with or even prey on each other.

At a local scale, druids are organized into circles that

share certain perspectives on nature, balance, and the

way ofthe druid.

### Circleofthe Land

The Circle of the Land is made up of mystics and sages

who safeguard ancient knowledge and rites through

a vast oral tradition.

These druids meet with in sacred

circles of trees or standing stones to whisper primal

secrets in Druidic.

The circle’swisest m em bers preside

as the chief priests of communities that hold to the Old

Faith and serve as advisors to the rulers of those folk.

As amem ber of this circle, you r magic is influenced

by the land where you were initiated into the circle’s

mysterious rites.

### Bonus Cantrip

W hen you choose this circle at 2nd level, you learn one

additional druid cantrip of you r choice.

### Natural Recovery

Starting at 2nd level, you can regain som e of you r

magical energy by sitting in meditation and com m uning

with nature.

During a short rest, you choose expended

spell slots to recover.

The spell slots can have a

com bined level that is equal to or less than half you r

druid level (rounded up), and none of the slots can be

6th level or higher.

You can’t use this feature again until

you finish a long rest

For example, when you are a 4th-level druid, you can

recover up to two levels w orth of spell slots.

You can

recover either a 2nd-level slot or two 1st-level slots.

### Circle Spells

Your mystical connection to the land infuses you with

the ability to cast certain spells.

At 3rd, 5th, 7th, and

9th level you gain access to circle spells connected

to the land where you becam eadruid.

C hoose that

land—arctic, coast, desert, forest, grassland, mountain,

swamp, or Underdark—and consult the associated

list of spells.

Once you gain access to a circle spell, you always have

it prepared, and it doesn’t count against the number of

spells you can prepare each day.

If you gain access to a

spell that doesn’t appear on the druid spell list, the spell

is nonetheless a druid spell for you.

You can

the y have thorns, spines, or a similar hazard.

In addition, you have advantage on saving throws against

plants that are magically created or manipulated to impede

movement, such those created by the entangle spell.

Nat ure ’sWa r d

W hen you reach 10th level, you can’t be charm ed or

Nat ure ’sSa nct uar y

W hen you reach 14th level, creatures of the natural

world sense you r connection to nature and becom e

hesitant to attack you.

W hen a beast or plant creature

attacks you, that creature must make aWisdom saving

throw against you r druid spell save DC.

On a failed save,

the creature must choose a different target, or the attack

automatically m isses.

On a successful save, the creature

is immune to this effect for 24 hours.

The creature is aware of this effect before it makes its

attack against you.

### Circleofthe Moon

Druids of the Circle of the M oon are fierce guardians

of the wilds.

Their order gathers under the full m oon to

share news and trade warnings.

They haunt the deepest

parts of the wilderness, where the y might go for weeks

on end before crossing paths with another humanoid

creature, let alone another druid.

Changeable as the m oon, a druid of this circle might

prowl as a great cat one night, soar over the treetops

as an eagle the next day, and crash through the

undergrowth in bear form to drive off a trespassing

monster.

The wild is in the druid's blood.

### Combat Wild Shape

W hen you choose this circle at 2nd level, you gain the

ability to use W ild Shape on you r turn as a bonus action,

rather than as an action.

Additionally, while you are transformed by W ild

Shape, you can use a bonus action to expend one

spell slot to regain 1d8 hit points per level of the spell

slot expended.

### Circle Forms

The rites of you r circle grant you the ability to transform

into m ore dangerous animal forms.

Starting at 2nd

level, you can use you r W ild Shape to transform into a

beast with a challenge rating as high as 1 (you ignore

the Max.

CR colum n of the Beast Shapes table, but must

abide by the other limitations the re).

Starting at 6th level, you can transform into a beast

with a challenge rating as high as you r druid level

divided by 3, rounded down.

Pri mal St rik e

Starting at 6th level, you r attacks in beast form count as

magical for the purpose of overcom ing resistance and

immunity to nonm agical attacks and damage.

### Elemental Wild Shape

At 10th level, you can expend two uses of W ild Shape

at the same time to transform into an air elemental, an

earth elemental, a fire elemental, or a water elemental.

### Thousand Forms

By 14th level, you have learned to use magic to alter

you r physical form in m ore subtle ways.

You can cast the

alter self spell at will.

### Druidsandthe Gods

Some druids venerate the forces of nature the mselves, but

most druids are devoted to one of the many nature deities

worshiped in the multiverse (the lists of gods in appendix

B include many such deities).

The worship of the se deities

is often considered a more ancient tradition than the faiths

of clerics and urbanized peoples.

In fact, in the world of

Greyhawk, the druidic faith is called the Old Faith, and it

claims many adherents among farmers, foresters, fishers,

and others who live closely with nature.

This tradition

includes the worship of Nature as a primal force beyond

personification, but also encompasses the worship of Beory,

the Oerth Mother, as well as devotees of Obad-Hai, Ehlonna,

and Ulaa.

In the worlds of Greyhawk and the Forgotten Realms,

druidic circles are not usually connected to the faith of a

single nature deity.

Any given circle in the Forgotten Realms,

for example, might include druids who revere Silvanus,

Mielikki, Eldath, Chauntea, or even the harsh Gods of Fury:

Talos, Malar, Auril, and Umberlee.

These nature gods are

often called the First Circle, the first among the druids, and

most druids count the m all (even the violent ones) as worthy

of veneration.

The druids of Eberron hold animistic beliefs completely

unconnected to the Sovereign Host, the Dark Six, or any of

the other religions of the world.

They believe that every living

thing and every natural phenomenon— sun, moon, wind,

fire, and the world itself—has a spirit.

Their spells, the n, are

a means to communicate with and command the se spirits.

Different druidic sects, though, hold different philosophies

about the proper relationship of the se spirits to each other

and to the forces of civilization.

The Ashbound, for example,

believe that arcane magic is an abomination against nature,

the Children of Winter venerate the forces of death, and the

Gatekeepers preserve ancient traditions meant to protect the

world from the incursion of aberrations.

### Fighter

A human in clanging plate armor holds her shield

before her as she runs toward the m assed goblins.

An

elf behind her, clad in studded leather armor, peppers

the goblins with arrows loosed from his exquisite

bow.

The half-orc nearby shouts orders, helping

the two combatants coordinate the ir assault to the

best advantage.

A dwarf in chain mail interposes his shield between

the ogre’s club and his com panion, knocking the deadly

blow aside.

His companion, a half-elf in scale armor,

swings two scim itars in a blinding whirl as she circles

the ogre, looking for a blind spot in its defenses.

A gladiator fights for sport in an arena, a master with

his trident and net, skilled at toppling foes and moving

the m around for the crow d’s delight—and his own

tactical advantage.

His opponent’s sword flares with

blue light an instant before she sends lightning flashing

forth to smite him.

All of the se heroes are fighters, perhaps the most

diverse class of characters in the worlds of Dun geo n s &

Dra gon s .

Questing knights, conquering overlords, royal

champions, elite foot soldiers, hardened mercenaries,

and bandit kings—as fighters, the y all share an

unparalleled mastery with w eapons and armor, and a

thorough knowledge of the skills of combat.

And the y

are well acquainted with death, both meting it out and

staring it defiantly in the face.

Wel l - Rou nde dSp eci ali sts

Fighters learn the basics of all com bat styles.

Every

fighter can swing an axe, fence with a rapier, wield a

longsword or a greatsword, use a bow, and even trap foes

in a net with som e degree of skill.

Likewise, a fighter is

adept with shields and every form of armor.

Beyond that

basic degree of familiarity, each fighter specializes in a

certain style of combat.

Som e concentrate on archery,

som e on fighting with two w eapons at once, and som e

on augmenting the ir martial skills with magic.

This

combination of broad general ability and extensive

specialization makes fighters superior combatants

on battlefields and in dungeons alike.

### Trainedfor Danger

Not every m em ber of the city watch, the village militia,

or the queen’s army is a fighter.

Most of the se troops are

relatively untrained soldiers with only the most basic

com bat knowledge.

Veteran soldiers, military officers,

trained bodyguards, dedicated knights, and similar

figures are fighters.

Som e fighters feel drawn to use the ir training as

adventurers.

The dungeon delving, monster slaying, and

other dangerous work com m on am ong adventurers is

second nature for a fighter, not all that different from

the life he or she left behind.

There are greater risks,

perhaps, but also much greater rewards—few fighters in

the city watch have the opportunity to discover a magic

flame tongue sword, for example.

### Creatinga Fighter

As you build you r fighter, think about two related

elements of you r character's background: W here did

you get you r combat training, and what set you apart

from the mundane warriors around you?

W ere you

particularly ruthless?

Did you get extra help from a

mentor, perhaps because of you r exceptional dedication?

What drove you to this training in the first place?

A

threat to you r homeland, a thirst for revenge, or a need

to prove you rself might all have been factors.

You might have enjoyed formal training in a noble’s

army or in a local militia.

Perhaps you trained in a war

academy, learning strategy, tactics, and military history.

Or you might be self-taught—unpolished but well tested.

Did you take up the sword as a way to escape the limits

of life on a farm, or are you following a proud family

tradition?

W here did you acquire you r w eapons and

armor?

They might have been military issue or family

heirlooms, or perhaps you scrim ped and saved for years

to buy the m.

Your armaments are now am ong you r

m ost important possessions—the only things that stand

between you and death’s embrace.

### Quick Build

You can make a fighter quickly by following the se

suggestions.

First, make Strength or Dexterity you r

highest ability score, depending on whether you

want to focus on melee w eapons or on archery (or

finesse weapons).

Your next-highest score should be

Constitution, or Intelligence if you plan to adopt the

Eldritch Knight martial archetype.

Second, choose

the soldier background.

### Hit Points

### Battle Master

Those who emulate the archetypal Battle Master

employ martial techniques passed down through

generations.

To a Battle Master, com bat is an academ ic

field, som etim es including subjects beyond battle such

as weaponsm ithing and calligraphy.

Not every fighter

absorbs the lessons of history, the ory, and artistry

that are reflected in the Battle Master archetype, but

those who do are well-rounded fighters of great skill

and knowledge.

### Combat Superiority

W hen you choose this archetype at 3rd level, you

learn maneuvers that are fueled by special dice called

superiority dice.

Maneuvers.

You learn three maneuvers of you r

choice, which are detailed under “Maneuvers” below.

Many maneuvers enhance an attack in som e way.

You

can use only one maneuver per attack.

You learn two additional maneuvers of you r choice

at 7th, 10th, and 15th level.

Each time you learn new

maneuvers, you can also replace one maneuver you

know with a different one.

which are d8s.

A superiority die is expended when you

use it.

You regain all of you r expended superiority dice

when you finish a short or long rest.

You gain another superiority die at 7th level and one

m ore at 15th level.

Saving Throws.

S om e of you r maneuvers require

you r target to make a saving throw to resist the

as follows:

Maneuver save DC = 8 + you r proficiency bonus +

you r Strength or Dexterity modifier (you r choice)

St ude nto fWa r

At 3rd level, you gain proficiency with one type of

artisan’s tools of you r choice.

### Know Your Enemy

the creature is you r equal, superior, or inferior in regard

to two of the following characteristics of you r choice:

### Eldritch Knight

The archetypal Eldritch Knight com bines the martial

mastery com m on to all fighters with a careful study of

magic.

Eldritch Knights use magical techniques similar

to those practiced by wizards.

They focus the ir study

on two of the eight schools of magic: abjuration and

evocation.

Abjuration spells grant an Eldritch Knight

additional protection in battle, and evocation spells deal

damage to many foes at once, extending the fighter’s

reach in combat.

These knights learn a comparatively

small number of spells, com m itting the m to m em ory

instead of keeping the m in a spellbook.

## Spellcasting

### Weapon Bond

W hen you reach 3rd level, you augment you r martial

prow ess with the ability to cast spells.

See chapter 10

for the general rules of spellcasting and chapter 11 for

the w izard spell list.

Cantrips.

You learn two cantrips of you r choice from

the w izard spell list.

You learn an additional wizard

cantrip of you r choice at 10th level.

Spell Slots.

The Eldritch Knight Spellcasting table

shows how many spell slots you have to cast you r

spells of 1st level and higher.

To cast one of the se

spells, you must expend a slot of the spell’s level or

higher.

You regain all expended spell slots when you

finish a long rest.

For example, if you know the 1st-level spell shield and

have a 1st-level and a 2nd-level spell slot available, you

can cast shield using either slot.

Spells Known of 1st-Level and Higher.

You know

three 1st-level wizard spells of you r choice, two of which

you must choose from the abjuration and evocation

spells on the wizard spell list.

The Spells Known colum n of the Eldritch Knight

Spellcasting table show s when you learn m ore wizard

spells of 1st level or higher.

Each of the se spells must be

an abjuration or evocation spell of you r choice, and must

be of a level for which you have spell slots.

For instance,

when you reach 7th level in this class, you can learn one

new spell o f 1st or 2nd level.

The spells you learn at 8th, 14th, and 20th level can

com e from any school of magic.

W henever you gain a level in this class, you can

replace one of the w izard spells you know with another

spell ofyour choice from the wizard spell list.

The

new spell must be of a level for which you have spell

slots, and it must be an abjuration or evocation spell,

unless you’re replacing the spell you gained at 8th, 14th,

or 20th level.

Spellcasting Ability.

Intelligence is you r spellcasting

ability for you r wizard spells, since you learn you r

spells through study and memorization.

You use you r

Intelligence when ever a spell refers to you r spellcasting

ability.

In addition, you use you r Intelligence modifier

when setting the saving throw DC for a wizard spell you

cast and when making an attack roll with one.

Spell save DC = 8 + you r proficiency bonus +

you r Intelligence modifier

Spell attack modifier = you r proficiency bonus +

you r Intelligence modifier

At 3rd level, you learn a ritual that creates a magical

bond between you rself and one weapon.

You perform

the ritual over the course of 1 hour, which can be done

during a short rest.

The w eapon must be with in you r

reach throughout the ritual, at the conclusion of which

you touch the weapon and forge the bond.

Once you have bonded aweapon to you rself, you

can’t be disarmed of that w eapon unless you are

incapacitated.

If it is on the same plane of existence,

you can sum m on that weapon as a bonus action on you r

turn, causing it to teleport instantly to you r hand.

You can have up to two bonded weapons, but can

sum m on only one at a time with you r bonus action.

If you attempt to bond with a third weapon, you must

break the bond with one of the other two.

### Monk

Her fists a blur as the y deflect an incom ing hail of arrows,

a half-elf springs over a barricade and throws herself

into the m assed ranks ofhobgoblins on the other side.

She whirls am ong the m, knocking the ir blows aside and

sending the m reeling, until at last she stands alone.

Taking a deep breath, a human covered in tattoos

settles into a battle stance.

As the first charging orc s

reach him, he exhales and a blast offire roars from his

mouth, engulfing his foes.

Moving with the silence of the night, a black-clad

halfling steps into a shadow beneath an arch and

em erges from another inky shadow on a balcony a

stone’s throw away.

She slides her blade free ofits cloth-

wrapped scabbard and peers through the open window

at the tyrant prince, so vulnerable in the grip ofsleep.

Whatever the ir discipline, m onks are united in the ir

ability to magically harness the energy that flows in

the ir bodies.

W hether channeled as a striking display

of com bat prowess or a subtler focus ofdefensive ability

and speed, this energy infuses all that a monk does.

### The Magicof Ki

M onks make careful study ofa magical energy that most

monastic traditions call ki.

This energy is an element

of the magic that suffuses the multiverse—specifically,

the element that flows through living bodies.

M onks

harness this power with in the mselves to create magical

effects and exceed the ir bodies' physical capabilities,

and som e of the ir special attacks can hinder the flow of

ki in the ir opponents.

Using this energy, m onks channel

uncanny speed and strength into the ir unarm ed strikes.

As the y gain experience, the ir martial training and the ir

mastery of ki gives the m m ore power over the ir bodies

and the bodies of the ir foes.

### Trainingand Asceticism

Sm all walled cloisters dot the landscapes ofthe worlds

ofD&D, tiny refuges from the flow of ordinary life,

where time seem s to stand still.

The m onks w ho live

the re seek personal perfection through contemplation

and rigorous training.

Many entered the monastery

as children, sent to live the re when the ir parents died,

when food couldn’t be found to support the m, or in

return for som e kindness that the m onks had perform ed

for the ir families.

S om emonks live entirely apart from the surrounding

population, secluded from anything that might impede

the ir spiritual progress.

Others are sworn to isolation,

em erging only to serve as spies or assassins at the

com m and of the ir leader, a noble patron, or som e other

mortal or divine power.

The majority ofm onks don’t shun the ir neighbors,

making frequent visits to nearby towns or villages and

exchanging the ir service for food and other goods.

As

versatile warriors, m onks often end up protecting the ir

neighbors from m onsters or tyrants.

For a monk, becom ing an adventurer means leaving

a structured, com m unal lifestyle to becom eawanderer.

This can be a harsh transition, and m onks don’t

undertake it lightly.

Those w ho leave the ir cloisters take

the ir w ork seriously, approaching the ir adventures as

personal tests of the ir physical and spiritual growth.

As a rule, m onks care little for material wealth and are

driven by a desire to accom plish a greater m ission than

merely slaying m onsters and plundering the ir treasure.

C REATING AMO N K

As you make you r monk character, think about you r

connection to the monastery where you learned you r

skills and spent you r formative years.

W ere you an

orphan or a child left on the monastery’s threshold?

Did

you r parents prom ise you to the m onastery in gratitude

for a service perform ed by the m onks?

Did you enter

this secluded life to hide from a crim e you com m itted?

Or did you choose the monastic life for you rself?

Consider why you left.

Did the head of you r monastery

choose you for a particularly important mission beyond

the cloister?

Perhaps you were cast out because of

som e violation of the com m unity’s rules.

Did you dread

leaving, or w ere you happy to go?

Is the re som ething

you hope to accom plish outside the monastery?

Are you

eager to return to you r home?

Asa result of the structured life ofa m onastic

community and the discipline required to harness ki,

m onks are almost always lawful in alignment.

### Quick Build

Perfect Self

### Unarmored Defense

Beginning at 1st level, while you are w earing no armor

and not wielding a shield, you r AC equals 10 + you r

Dexterity modifier + you r W isdom modifier.

### Martial Arts

At 1st level, you r practice of martial arts gives you

mastery of combat styles that use unarm ed strikes and

m onk weapons, which are shortswords and any simple

melee w eapons that don’t have the two-handed or

heavy property.

You gain the following benefits while you are unarmed

or wielding only m onk w eapons and you aren’t wearing

armor or wielding a shield:

• You can use Dexterity instead of Strength for the

attack and damage rolls ofyour unarmed strikes and

m onk weapons.

• You can roll a d4 in place of the normal damage

of you r unarm ed strike or m onk weapon.

This die

changes as you gain m onk levels, as shown in the

Martial Arts colum n of the M onk table.

• W hen you use the Attack action with an unarmed

strike or amonk w eapon on you r turn, you can make

one unarmed strike as a bonus action.

For example, if

you take the Attack action and attack with a quarter-

staff, you can also make an unarmed strike as a bonus

action, assum ing you have n't already taken a bonus

action this turn.

Certain m onasteries use specialized form s of the

m onk weapons.

For example, you might use a club

that is two lengths of w ood connected by a short chain

(called a nunchaku) or a sickle with a shorter, straighter

blade (called a kama).

Whatever name you use for a

m onk weapon, you can use the game statistics provided

for the weapon in chapter 5.

### Ki

Starting at 2nd level, you r training allows you to

harness the mystic energy of ki.

Your access to this

energy is represented by a number of ki points.

Your

m onk level determines the number of points you have,

as shown in the Ki Points colum n of the M onk table.

You can spend the se points to fuel various ki features.

You start knowing three such features: Flurry of Blows,

Patient Defense, and Step of the Wind.

You learn m ore

ki features as you gain levels in this class.

W hen you spend a ki point, it is unavailable until

you finish a short or long rest, at the end of which you

draw all of you r expended ki back into you rself.

You

must spend at least 30 minutes of the rest meditating to

regain you r ki points.

Som e of you r ki features require you r target to make

a saving throw to resist the feature’s effects.

The saving

throw DC is calculated as follows:

Ki save DC = 8 + you r proficiency bonus +

you r Wisdom modifier

### Flurryof Blows

Immediately after you take the Attack action on you r

turn, you can spend 1 ki point to make two unarmed

strikes as a bonus action.

Pa tie ntD efe nse

You can spend 1 ki point to take the Dodge action as a

bonus action on you r turn.

St epo fth eWi n d

You can spend 1 ki point to take the Disengage or Dash

action as a bonus action on you r turn, and you r jump

distance is doubled for the turn.

### Unarmored Movement

Starting at 2nd level, you r speed increases by 10 feet

while you are not w earing armor or wielding a shield.

This bonus increases when you reach certain monk

levels, as shown in the M onk table.

At 9th level, you gain the ability to move along vertical

surfaces and across liquids on you r turn with out falling

during the move.

### Monastic Tradition

W hen you reach 3rd level, you com m it you rself to a

monastic tradition: the Way of the Open Hand, the Way

ofShadow, or the Way ofthe Four Elements, all detailed

at the end of the class description.

Your tradition

grants you features at 3rd level and again at 6th, 11th,

and 17th level.

### Deflect Missiles

Starting at 3rd level, you can use you r reaction to

deflect or catch the missile when you are hit by a ranged

weapon attack.

W hen you do so, the damage you take

from the attack is reduced by 1d 10 + you r Dexterity

modifier + you r m onk level.

If you reduce the damage to 0, you can catch the

missile if it is small enough for you to hold in one hand

and you have at least one hand free.

If you catch a

missile in this way, you can spend 1 ki point to make a

ranged attack with the weapon or piece of ammunition

you just caught, as part of the sam e reaction.

You make

this attack with proficiency, regardless ofyour weapon

proficiencies, and the missile counts as amonk weapon

for the attack.

### Ability Score Improvement

W hen you reach 4th level, and again at 8th, 12th, 16th,

and 19th level, you can increase one ability score of you r

choice by 2, or you can increase two ability scores of

you r choice by 1.

As normal, you can’t increase an ability

score above 20 using this feature.

### Slow Fall

Beginning at 4th level, you can use you r reaction when

you fall to reduce any falling damage you take by an

amount equal to five times you r m onk level.

### Extra Attack

Beginning at 5th level, you can attack twice, instead of

once, when ever you take the Attack action on you r turn.

### Stunning Strike

Starting at 5th level, you can interfere with the flow of

ki in an opponent’s body.

W hen you hit another creature

with a melee w eapon attack, you can spend 1 ki point to

attempt a stunning strike.

The target must succeed on a

Constitution saving throw or be stunned until the end of

you r next turn.

K i - Emp owe red Str ike s

Starting at 6th level, you r unarm ed strikes count as

magical for the purpose of overcom ing resistance and

immunity to nonm agical attacks and damage.

### Evasion

At 7th level, you r instinctive agility lets you dodge

out of the way of certain area effects, such as a blue

dragon’s lightning breath or a fireball spell.

W hen you

are subjected to an effect that allows you to make a

Dexterity saving throw to take only half damage, you

instead take no damage if you succeed on the saving

throw, and only half damage if you fail.

### Stillnessof Mind

Starting at 7th level, you can use you r action to end one

effect on you rself that is causing you to be charm ed

or frightened.

### Purityof Body

At 10th level, you r mastery of the ki flowing through you

makes you immune to disease and poison.

### Tongueofthe Sunand Moon

Starting at 13th level, you learn to touch the ki of other

minds so that you understand all spoken languages.

Moreover, any creature that can understand a language

can understand what you say.

### Diamond Soul

Beginning at 14th level, you r mastery of ki grants you

proficiency in all saving throws.

Additionally, when ever you make a saving throw and

fail, you can spend 1 ki point to reroll it and take the

second result.

During that time, you also have resistance to all damage

but force damage.

Additionally, you can spend 8 ki points to cast the

astral projection spell, with out needing material

com ponents.

W hen you do so, you can’t take any other

creatures with you.

### Perfect Self

At 20th level, when you roll for initiative and have no ki

points remaining, you regain 4 ki points.

### Monastic Traditions

Three traditions of monastic pursuit are com m on in

the monasteries scattered across the multiverse.

Most

m onasteries practice one tradition exclusively, but a

few honor the three traditions and instruct each monk

according to his or her aptitude and interest.

All three

traditions rely on the sam e basic techniques, diverging

as the student grows m ore adept.

Thus, amonk need

choose a tradition only upon reaching 3rd level.

### Wayofthe Open Hand

M onks of the Way of the Open Hand are the ultimate

masters of martial arts combat, whether armed or

unarmed.

They learn techniques to push and trip the ir

opponents, manipulate ki to heal damage to the ir

bodies, and practice advanced meditation that can

protect the m from harm.

### Open Hand Technique

Starting when you choose this tradition at 3rd level,

you can manipulate you r enemy’s ki when you harness

you r own.

W henever you hit a creature with one of the

attacks granted by you r Flurry of Blows, you can im pose

one of the following effects on that target:

• It must succeed on a Dexterity saving throw or be

knocked prone.

• It must make a Strength saving throw.

If it fails, you

can push it up to 15 feet away from you.

• It can’t take reactions until the end of you r next turn.

### Wholenessof Body

At 6th level, you gain the ability to heal you rself.

As an

action, you can regain hit points equal to three times

### Timeless Body

At 15th level, you r ki sustains you so that you suffer

none of the frailty of old age, and you can't be aged

magically.

You can still die of old age, however.

In

addition, you no longer need food or water.

### Empty Body

Beginning at 18th level, you can use you r action to

spend 4 ki points to becom e invisible for 1 minute.

you r m onk level.

You must finish a long rest before you

can use this feature again.

### Tranquility

Beginning at 11th level, you can enter a special

meditation that surrounds you with an aura of peace.

At

the end of a long rest, you gain the effect of a sanctuary

spell that lasts until the start of you r next long rest (the

spell can end early as normal).

The saving throw DC

for the spell equals 8 + you r W isdom modifier + you r

proficiency bonus.

Qui ver ing Pa l m

At 17th level, you gain the ability to set up lethal

vibrations in som eone’s body.

W hen you hit a creature

with an unarmed strike, you can spend 3 ki points to

start the se im perceptible vibrations, which last for a

number of days equal to you r m onk level.

The vibrations

are harm less unless you use you r action to end the m.

To do so, you and the target must be on the sam e plane

of existence.

W hen you use this action, the creature

must make a Constitution saving throw.

If it fails, it is

reduced to 0 hit points.

If it succeeds, it takes 10d 10

necrotic damage.

You can have only one creature under the effect of this

feature at a time.

You can choose to end the vibrations

harmlessly with out using an action.

### Wayof Shadow

Monks of the Way of Shadow follow a tradition that

values stealth and subterfuge.

These m onks might

be called ninjas or shadowdancers, and the y serve as

spies and assassins.

Som etim es the m em bers of a

ninja monastery are family mem bers, form ing a clan

sworn to secrecy about the ir arts and missions.

Other

m onasteries are m ore like thieves’ guilds, hiring out

the ir services to nobles, rich merchants, or anyone else

who can pay the ir fees.

Regardless of the ir methods, the

heads of the se m onasteries expect the unquestioning

obedience of the ir students.

### Shadow Arts

Starting when you choose this tradition at 3rd level, you

can use you r ki to duplicate the effects of certain spells.

As an action, you can spend 2 ki points to cast darkness,

darkvision, pass with out trace, or silence, with out

providing material com ponents.

Additionally, you gain

the minor illusion cantrip if you don’t already know it.

Sha dow St e p

At 6th level, you gain the ability to step from one shadow

into another.

W hen you are in dim light or darkness,

as a bonus action you can teleport up to 60 feet to an

unoccupied space you can see that is also in dim light

or darkness.

You the n have advantage on the first melee

attack you make before the end of the turn.

### Cloakof Shadows

By 11th level, you have learned to becom e one with

the shadows.

W hen you are in an area of dim light or

darkness, you can use you r action to becom e invisible.

You remain invisible until you make an attack, cast a

spell, or are in an area of bright light.

### Opportunist

At 17th level, you can exploit a creature's momentary

distraction when it is hit by an attack.

W henever a

creature with in 5 feet of you is hit by an attack made by

a creature other than you, you can use you r reaction to

make a melee attack against that creature.

### Wayofthe Four Elements

You follow a monastic tradition that teaches you to

harness the elements.

W hen you focus you r ki, you can

align you rself with the forces of creation and bend the

four elements to you r will, using the m as an extension

of you r body.

Som emem bers of this tradition dedicate

the mselves to a single element, but others weave the

elements together.

Many m onks of this tradition tattoo the ir bodies with

representations of the ir ki powers, com m only imagined

as coiling dragons, but also as phoenixes, fish, plants,

mountains, and cresting waves.

### Discipleofthe Elements

W hen you choose this tradition at 3rd level, you learn

magical disciplines that harness the power of the four

elements.

A discipline requires you to spend ki points

each time you use it.

You know the Elemental Attunement discipline and

one other elemental discipline of you r choice, which are

detailed in the “Elemental Disciplines” section below.

You learn one additional elemental discipline of you r

choice at 6th, 11th, and 17th level.

W henever you learn a new elemental discipline,

you can also replace one elemental discipline that you

already know with a different discipline.

Casting Elemental Spells.

Som e elemental

disciplines allow you to cast spells.

S ee chapter 10 for

the general rules of spellcasting.

To cast one ofthese

spells, you use its casting time and other rules, but you

don’t need to provide material com ponents for it.

Once you reach 5th level in this class, you can spend

additional ki points to increase the level of an elemental

discipline spell that you cast, provided that the spell has

an enhanced effect at a higher level, as burning hands

does.

The spell's level increases by 1 for each additional

ki point you spend.

For example, if you are a 5th-level

m onk and use Sweeping Cinder Strike to cast burning

hands, you can spend 3 ki points to cast it as a 2nd-level

spell (the discipline’s base cost of 2 ki points plus 1).

The maximum num ber of ki points you can spend to

cast a spell in this way (including its base ki point cost

and any additional ki points you spend to increase its

level) is determined by you r m onk level, as shown in the

Spells and Ki Points table.

### Monastic Orders

The worlds of D&D contain a multitude of monasteries

and monastic traditions.

In lands with an Asian cultural

flavor, such as Shou Lung far to the east of the Forgotten

Realms, the se monasteries are associated with philosophical

traditions and martial arts practice.

The Iron Hand School,

the Five Stars School, the Northern Fist School, and

the Southern Star School of Shou Lung teach different

approaches to the physical, mental, and spiritual disciplines

of the monk.

Some of the se monasteries have spread to the

western lands of Faerun, particularly in places with large

Shou immigrant communities, such as Thesk and Westgate.

Other monastic traditions are associated with deities who

teach the value of physical excellence and mental discipline.

In the Forgotten Realms, the order of the Dark Moon is

made up of monks dedicated to Shar (goddess of loss), who

maintain secret communities in remote hills, back allies,

and subterranean hideaways.

Monasteries of Ilmater (god

of endurance) are named after flowers, and the ir orders

carry the names of great heroes of the faith; the Disciples of

Saint Sollars the Twice-Martyred reside in the Monastery of

the Yellow Rose near Damara.

The monasteries of Eberron

combine the study of martial arts with a life of scholarship.

Most are devoted to the deities of the Sovereign Host.

In the world of Dragonlance, most monks are devoted to

Majere, god of meditation and thought.

In Greyhawk, many

monasteries are dedicated to Xan Yae, the goddess of twilight

and the superiority of mind over matter, or to Zuoken, god of

mental and physical mastery.

The evil monks of the Scarlet Brotherhood in the world of

Greyhawk derive the ir fanatic zeal not from devotion to a god

but from dedication to the principles of the ir nation and the ir

race— the belief that the Suel strand of humanity are meant

to rule the world.

Pa lad i n

Clad in plate armor that gleam s in the sunlight despite

the dust and grime of long travel, a human lays down

her sword and shield and places her hands on a mortally

wounded man.

Divine radiance shines from her hands,

the man’s wounds knit closed, and his eyes open wide

with amazement.

A dwarf crouches behind an outcrop, his black cloak

making him nearly invisible in the night, and watches

an orc war band celebrating its recent victory.

Silently,

he stalks into the ir midst and w hispers an oath, and two

ores are dead before the y even realize he is the re.

Silver hair shining in a shaft oflight that seem s to

illuminate only him, an elf laughs with exultation.

His

spear flashes like his eyes as he jabs again and again

at a twisted giant, until at last his light overcom es its

hideous darkness.

Whatever the ir origin and the ir mission, paladins are

united by the ir oaths to stand against the forces of evil.

W hether sworn before a god’s altar and the witness of

a priest, in a sacred glade before nature spirits and fey

beings, or in a moment of desperation and grief with the

dead as the only witness, a paladin’s oath is a powerful

bond.

It is a source of power that turns a devout warrior

into a blessed champion.

### The Causeof Righteousness

A paladin swears to uphold justice and righteousness,

to stand with the good things of the world against the

encroaching darkness, and to hunt the forces of evil

wherever the y lurk.

Different paladins focus on various

aspects of the cause of righteousness, but all are

bound by the oaths that grant the m power to do the ir

sacred work.

Although many paladins are devoted to

gods of good, a paladin’s power com es as much from a

commitment to justice itself as it does from a god.

Paladins train for years to learn the skills ofcombat,

mastering a variety ofw eapons and armor.

Even so,

the ir martial skills are secondary to the magical power

the y wield: power to heal the sick and injured, to smite

the wicked and the undead, and to protect the innocent

and those who join the m in the fight for justice.

### Beyondthe Mundane Life

Alm ost by definition, the life of a paladin is an

adventuring life.

Unless a lasting injury has taken him

or her away from adventuring for a time, every paladin

lives on the front lines of the cosm ic struggle against

evil.

Fighters are rare enough am ong the ranks of the

militias and arm ies of the world, but even fewer people

can claim the true calling of a paladin.

W hen the y do

receive the call, the se w arriors turn from the ir former

occupations and take up arms to fight evil.

Som etim es

the ir oaths lead the m into the service of the crown as

leaders of elite groups of knights, but even the n the ir

loyalty is first to the cause of righteousness, not to

crow n and country.

Adventuring paladins take the ir work seriously.

A

delve into an ancient ruin or dusty crypt can be a quest

driven by a higher purpose than the acquisition of

treasure.

Evil lurks in dungeons and primeval forests,

and even the smallest victory against it can tilt the

cosm ic balance away from oblivion.

### Creatinga Paladin

The m ost important aspect of a paladin character is

the nature of his or her holy quest.

Although the class

features related to you r oath don't appear until you

reach 3rd level, plan ahead for that choice by reading

the oath descriptions at the end of the class.

Are you a

devoted servant of good, loyal to the gods of justice and

honor, a holy knight in shining armor venturing forth

to smite evil?

Are you a glorious champion of the light,

cherishing everything beautiful that stands against the

shadow, a knight w hose oath descends from traditions

older than many ofthe gods?

Or are you an embittered

loner sworn to take vengeance on those who have done

great evil, sent as an angel of death by the gods or driven

by you r need for revenge?

Appendix B lists many deities

worshiped by paladins throughout the multiverse, such

as Torm, Tyr, Heironeous,

Paladine, Kiri-Jolith, Dol

Arrah, the Silver Flame,

Bahamut, Athena, Re-Horakhty,

and Heimdall.

How did you experience you r call to

serve as a paladin?

Did you hear a whisper

from an unseen god or angel while you were at

prayer?

Did another paladin sense the potential with in

you and decide to train you as a squire?

Or did som e

terrible event—the destruction of you r home, perhaps—

drive you to you r quests?

Perhaps you stumbled into

a sacred grove or a hidden elven enclave and found

you rself called to protect all such refuges of goodness

and beauty.

Or you might have known from you r earliest

m em ories that the paladin’s life was you r calling, almost

as if you had been sent into the world with that purpose

stamped on you r soul.

As guardians against the forces of wickedness,

paladins are rarely of any evil alignment.

M ost of the m

walk the paths of charity and justice.

Consider how you r

alignment colors the way you pursue you r holy quest

and the manner in which you conduct you rself before

gods and mortals.

Your oath and alignment might be

in harmony, or you r oath might represent standards of

behavior that you have not yet attained.

### Quick Build

You can make a paladin quickly by following the se

suggestions.

First, Strength should be you r highest

ability score, followed by Charisma.

Second, choose the

noble background.

### Hit Points

Hit Dice: 1d10 per paladin level

## Equipment

### Divine Sense

You start with the following equipment, in addition to

the equipment granted by you r background:

• (a) a martial weapon and a shield or (b) two martial

weapons

• (a) five javelins or (b) any simple melee weapon

• (a) a priest’s pack or (b) an explorer’s pack

• Chain mail and a holy symbol

The presence of strong evil registers on you r senses like

a noxious odor, and powerful good rings like heavenly

music in you r ears.

As an action, you can open you r

awareness to detect such forces.

Until the end of you r

next turn, you know the location of any celestial, fiend,

or undead with in 60 feet of you that is not behind total

cover.

You know the type (celestial, fiend, or undead) of

any being w hose presence you sense, but not its identity

(the vampire Count Strahd von Zarovich, for instance).

Within the sam e radius, you also detect the presence

ofany place or object that has been consecrated or

desecrated, as with the hallow spell.

You can use this feature a num ber of times equal to

1 + you r Charisma modifier.

W hen you finish a long rest,

you regain all expended uses.

### Layon Hands

Your blessed touch can heal wounds.

You have a pool

of healing power that replenishes when you take a long

rest.

With that pool, you can restore a total number of

hit points equal to you r paladin level x 5.

As an action, you can touch a creature and draw

power from the pool to restore a num ber of hit points

to that creature, up to the maximum amount remaining

in you r pool.

Alternatively, you can expend 5 hit points from you r

pool of healing to cure the target of one disease or

neutralize one poison affecting it.

You can cure multiple

diseases and neutralize multiple poisons with a single

use ofLay on Hands, expending hit points separately

for each one.

This feature has no effect on undead and constructs.

At 2nd level, you adopt a style of fighting as you r

specialty.

C hoose one of the following options.

You can’t

take a Fighting Style option m ore than once, even if you

later get to choose again.

### Defense

W hile you are wearing armor, you gain a +1 bonus to AC.

### Dueling

W hen you are wielding a melee weapon in one hand and

no other weapons, you gain a +2 bonus to damage rolls

with that weapon.

### Great Weapon Fighting

W hen you roll a 1 or 2 on a damage die for an attack you

make with a melee weapon that you are wielding with

two hands, you can reroll the die and must use the new

roll.

The weapon must have the two-handed or versatile

property for you to gain this benefit.

### Protection

W hen a creature you can see attacks a target other

than you that is with in 5 feet of you, you can use you r

reaction to im pose disadvantage on the attack roll.

You must be wielding a shield.

## Spellcasting

### Preparingand Casting Spells

By 2nd level, you have learned to draw on divine

m agic through meditation and prayer to cast spells as

a cleric does.

See chapter 10 for the general rules of

spellcasting and chapter 11 for the paladin spell list.

The Paladin table show s how many spell slots you have

to cast you r spells.

To cast one of you r paladin spells of

1st level or higher, you must expend a slot of the spell’s

level or higher.

You regain all expended spell slots when

you finish a long rest.

You prepare the list of paladin spells that are available

for you to cast, choosing from the paladin spell list.

W hen you do so, choose a number of paladin spells

equal to you r Charisma modifier + half you r paladin

level, rounded down (minimum of one spell).

The spells

must be of a level for which you have spell slots.

For example, if you are a 5th-level paladin, you have

four 1st-level and two 2nd-level spell slots.

With a

Charisma of 14, you r list of prepared spells can include

four spells of 1st or 2nd level, in any combination.

If you

prepare the 1st-level spell cure wounds, you can cast

it using a 1st-level or a 2nd-level slot.

Casting the spell

doesn’t remove it from you r list of prepared spells.

You can change you r list of prepared spells when you

finish a long rest.

Preparing a new list ofpaladin spells

requires time spent in prayer and meditation: at least 1

minute per spell level for each spell on you r list.

### Spellcasting Ability

Charisma is you r spellcasting ability for you r paladin

spells, since the ir pow er derives from the strength of

you r convictions.

You use you r Charisma when ever a

spell refers to you r spellcasting ability.

In addition, you

use you r Charisma m odifier when setting the saving

throw DC for a paladin spell you cast and when making

an attack roll with one.

Spell save DC = 8 + you r proficiency bonus +

you r Charisma modifier

Spell attack modifier = you r proficiency bonus +

you r Charisma modifier

### Spellcasting Focus

You can use a holy sym bol (found in chapter 5) as a

spellcasting focus for you r paladin spells.

### Divine Smite

Starting at 2nd level, when you hit a creature with a

melee weapon attack, you can expend one paladin spell

slot to deal radiant damage to the target, in addition to

the w eapon’s damage.

The extra damage is 2d8 for a

1st-level spell slot, plus 1d8 for each spell level higher

than 1st, to a maximum of 5d8.

The damage increases

by 1d8 if the target is an undead or a fiend.

### Divine Health

By 3rd level, the divine magic flowing through you

m akes you immune to disease.

### Sacred Oath

W hen you reach 3rd level, you swear the oath that binds

you as a paladin forever.

Up to this time you have been

in a preparatory stage, com m itted to the path but not

yet sworn to it.

Now you choose the Oath of Devotion,

the Oath of the Ancients, or the Oath of Vengeance, all

detailed at the end of the class description.

Your choice grants you features at 3rd level and again

at 7th, 15th, and 20th level.

Those features include oath

spells and the Channel Divinity feature.

### Oath Spells

Each oath has a list of associated spells.

You gain

access to the se spells at the levels specified in the oath

description.

Once you gain access to an oath spell, you

always have it prepared.

Oath spells don’t count against

the number of spells you can prepare each day.

If you gain an oath spell that doesn’t appear on the

paladin spell list, the spell is nonetheless a paladin

spell for you.

### Channel Divinity

Your oath allows you to channel divine energy to fuel

m agical effects.

Each Channel Divinity option provided

by you r oath explains how to use it.

W hen you use you r Channel Divinity, you choose

which option to use.

You must the n finish a short or long

rest to use you r Channel Divinity again.

Som e Channel Divinity effects require saving throws.

W hen you use such an effect from this class, the DC

equals you r paladin spell save DC.

### Ability Score Improvement

W hen you reach 4th level, and again at 8th, 12th, 16th,

and 19th level, you can increase one ability score of you r

choice by 2, or you can increase two ability scores of

you r choice by 1.

As normal, you can’t increase an ability

score above 20 using this feature.

### Extra Attack

Beginning at 5th level, you can attack twice, instead of

once, when ever you take the Attack action on you r turn.

### Auraof Protection

Starting at 6th level, when ever you or a friendly creature

with in 10 feet of you must make a saving throw, the

creature gains a bonus to the saving throw equal to you r

Charisma m odifier (with a minim um bonus of +1).

You

must be conscious to grant this bonus.

At 18th level, the range of this aura increases to 30 feet.

### Auraof Courage

Starting at 10th level, you and friendly creatures

with in 10 feet of you can’t be frightened while you

are conscious.

At 18th level, the range of this aura increases to 30 feet.

### Improved Divine Smite

By 11th level, you are so suffused with righteous

might that all you r melee w eapon strikes carry divine

power with the m.

W henever you hit a creature with a

melee weapon, the creature takes an extra 1d8 radiant

damage.

If you also use you r Divine Smite with an

attack, you add this damage to the extra damage ofyour

Divine Smite.

### Cleansing Touch

Beginning at 14th level, you can use you r action to

end one spell on you rself or on one will ing creature

that you touch.

You can use this feature a number of times equal

to you r Charisma m odifier (a minimum ofonce).

You

regain expended uses when you finish a long rest.

Sa cre dOa ths

B ecom ing a paladin involves taking vows that commit

the paladin to the cause of righteousness, an active

path of fighting wickedness.

The final oath, taken

when he or she reaches 3rd level, is the culmination

of all the paladin’s training.

Som e characters with this

class don’t consider the mselves true paladins until

the y have reached 3rd level and made this oath.

For

others, the actual swearing of the oath is a formality,

an official stamp on what has always been true in the

paladin’s heart.

### Oathof Devotion

The Oath of Devotion binds a paladin to the loftiest

ideals of justice, virtue, and order.

Som etim es called

cavaliers, white knights, or holy warriors, the se

paladins meet the ideal of the knight in shining armor,

acting with honor in pursuit ofjustice and the greater

good.

They hold the mselves to the highest standards of

conduct, and som e, for better or w orse, hold the rest of

the world to the same standards.

Many who swear this

oath are devoted to gods of law and good and use the ir

gods’ tenets as the measure oftheir devotion.

They hold

angels—the perfect servants ofgood—as the ir ideals,

and incorporate im ages of angelic wings into the ir

helmets or coats of arms.

### Tenetsof Devotion

Though the exact w ords and strictures of the Oath of

Devotion vary, paladins of this oath share the se tenets.

Honesty.

D on’t lie or cheat.

Let you r word be

you r promise.

Courage.

Never fear to act, though caution is wise.

Compassion.

Aid others, protect the weak, and

punish those who threaten the m.

Show m ercy to you r

foes, but temper it with wisdom .

Honor.

Treat others with fairness, and let you r

honorable deeds be an example to the m.

Doas

much good as possible while causing the least

amount of harm.

Duty.

Be responsible for you r actions and the ir

consequences, protect those entrusted to you r care,

and obey those w ho have just authority over you.

### Oath Spells

You gain oath spells at the paladin levels listed.

### Breaking Your Oath

A paladin tries to hold to the highest standards of conduct,

but even the most virtuous paladin is fallible.

Sometimes

the right path proves too demanding, sometimes a situation

calls for the lesser of two evils, and sometimes the heat of

emotion causes a paladin to transgress his or her oath.

A paladin who has broken a vow typically seeks absolution

from a cleric who shares his or her faith or from another

paladin of the same order.

The paladin might spend an all-

night vigil in prayer as a sign of penitence, or undertake a

fast or similar act of self-denial.

After a rite of confession and

forgiveness, the paladin starts fresh.

If a paladin will fully violates his or her oath and shows no

sign of repentance, the consequences can be more serious.

At the DM's discretion, an impenitent paladin might be

forced to abandon this class and adopt another, or perhaps

to take the Oathbreaker paladin option that appears in the

Dungeon Master's Guide.

reactions.

For its action, it can use only the Dash action

or try to escape from an effect that prevents it from

moving.

If the re’s nowhere to move, the creature can use

the D odge action.

### Auraof Devotion

Starting at 7th level, you and friendly creatures with in

10 feet ofyou can’t be charm ed while you are conscious.

At 18th level, the range of this aura increases to 30 feet.

### Purityof Spirit

Beginning at 15th level, you are always under the effects

of a protection from evil and good spell.

Hol yNim bus

At 20th level, as an action, you can emanate an aura of

sunlight.

For 1 minute, bright light shines from you in a

30-foot radius, and dim light shines 30 feet beyond that.

Whenever an enemy creature starts its turn in the

bright light, the creature takes 10 radiant damage.

In addition, for the duration, you have advantage on

saving throws against spells cast by fiends or undead.

Once you use this feature, you can’t use it again until

you finish a long rest.

### Oathofthe Ancients

The Oath of the Ancients is as old as the race of elves

and the rituals of the druids.

Som etim es called fey

knights, green knights, or horned knights, paladins who

swear this oath cast the ir lot with the side of the light

in the cosm ic struggle against darkness because the y

love the beautiful and life-giving things of the world,

not necessarily because the y believe in principles of

honor, courage, and justice.

They adorn the ir arm or and

clothing with images of growing things—leaves, antlers,

or flowers—to reflect the ir commitment to preserving

life and light in the world.

### Tenetsofthe Ancients

The tenets of the Oath of the Ancients have been

preserved for uncounted centuries.

This oath

emphasizes the principles of good above any concerns

of law or chaos.

Its four central principles are simple.

### Channel Divinity

W hen you take this oath at 3rd level, you gain the

Sacred Weapon.

As an action, you can imbue one

you r Charisma modifier to attack rolls made with that

weapon (with a minimum bonus of +1).

The w eapon also

emits bright light in a 20-foot radius and dim light 20

feet beyond that.

If the weapon is not already magical, it

becom es magical for the duration.

You can end this effect on you r turn as part of any

other action.

If you are no longer holding or carrying

this weapon, or if you fall unconscious, this effect ends.

Turn the Unholy.

As an action, you present you r

holy sym bol and speak a prayer censuring fiends and

that would swallow it.

W here life flourishes, stand

can hear you must make aWisdom saving throw.

On a

failed save, the creature is turned for 1 minute or until it

takes damage.

A turned creature must spend its turns trying to move

as far away from you as it can, and it can’t will ingly

m ove to a space with in 30 feet of you.

It also can’t take

reactions.

For its action, it can use only the Dash action

or try to escape from an effect that prevents it from

moving.

If the re’s nowhere to move, the creature can use

the D odge action.

If the creature’s true form is concealed by an illusion,

shapeshifting, or other effect, that form is revealed while

it is turned.

### Auraof Warding

Beginning at 7th level, ancient magic lies so heavily

upon you that it forms an eldritch ward.

You and friendly

creatures with in 10 feet of you have resistance to

damage from spells.

At 18th level, the range of this aura increases to 30 feet.

### Undying Sentinel

Starting at 15th level, when you are reduced to 0 hit

points and are not killed outright, you can choose to

drop to 1 hit point instead.

Once you use this ability, you

Additionally, you suffer none of the drawbacks ofold

age, and you can’t be aged magically.

### Elder Champion

force of nature, taking on an appearance you choose.

For example, you r skin might turn green or take on a

bark-like texture, you r hair might becom e leafy or m oss-

Using you r action, you undergo a transformation.

For 1 minute, you gain the following benefits:

• At the start of each of you r turns, you regain 10 hit

points.

• W henever you cast a paladin spell that has a casting

time of 1 action, you can cast it using a bonus action

instead.

tage on saving throws against you r paladin spells and

Channel Divinity options.

Once you use this feature, you can’t use it again until

you finish a long rest.

### Oathof Vengeance

The Oath of Vengeance is a solem n commitment to

punish those who have com m itted a grievous sin.

W hen

evil forces slaughter helpless villagers, when an entire

people turns against the will of the gods, when a thieves’

guild grows too violent and powerful, when a dragon

rampages through the countryside—at times like the se,

paladins arise and swear an Oath of Vengeance to set

right that which has gone wrong.

To the se paladins—

som etim es called avengers or dark knights—the ir own

purity is not as important as delivering justice.

and fiends to hear.

### Tenetsof Vengeance

The tenets of the Oath of Vengeance vary by paladin, but

all the tenets revolve around punishing wrongdoers by

any means necessary.

Paladins w ho uphold the se tenets

are will ing to sacrifice even the ir own righteousness to

mete out justice upon those w ho do evil, so the paladins

are often neutral or lawful neutral in alignment.

The

core principles of the tenets are brutally simple.

Fight the Greater Evil.

Faced with a choice of fighting

my sworn foes or combating a lesser evil.

I choose the

greater evil.

No Mercy for the Wicked.

Ordinary foes might win

my mercy, but my sworn enem ies do not.

By Any Means Necessary.

My qualms can’t get in the

way of exterminating my foes.

Restitution.

If my foes w reak ruin on the world, it is

You gain advantage

on attack rolls against the creature for 1 minute or until

off a foe’s retreat.

W hen you hit a creature with an

opportunity attack, you can move up to half you r

speed immediately after the attack and as part of

the same reaction.

This movement doesn’t provoke

opportunity attacks.

### Soulof Vengeance

you r foe.

### Ranger

Rough and wild looking,

a human stalks alone

through the shadows of

trees, hunting the ores he

knows are planning a raid

on a nearby farm.

Clutching

a shortsword in each hand,

he becom es a whirlwind of

steel, cutting down one enemy

after another.

After tumbling away from a cone of

freezing air, an elf finds her feet and draws

back her bow to loose an arrow at the white

dragon.

Shrugging off the wave of fear that emanates

from the dragon like the cold of its breath, she sends

one arrow after another to find the gaps between the

dragon’s thick scales.

Holding his hand high, a half-elf whistles to the hawk

that circles high above him, calling the bird back to his

side.

W hispering instructions in Elvish, he points to

the owlbear he’s been tracking and sends the hawk to

distract the creature while he readies his bow.

Far from the bustle of cities and towns, past the

hedges that shelter the most distant farms from the

terrors of the wild, amid the dense-packed trees of

trackless forests and across wide and empty plains,

rangers keep the ir unending watch.

### Deadly Hunters

W arriors of the wilderness, rangers specialize in

hunting the m onsters that threaten the edges of

civilization—humanoid raiders, rampaging beasts and

monstrosities, terrible giants, and deadly dragons.

They

learn to track the ir quarry as a predator does, moving

stealthily through the wilds and hiding the mselves in

brush and rubble.

Rangers focus the ir com bat training

on techniques that are particularly useful against the ir

specific favored foes.

Thanks to the ir familiarity with the wilds, rangers

acquire the ability to cast spells that harness nature’s

power, much as a druid does.

Their spells, like the ir

com bat abilities, emphasize speed, stealth, and the hunt.

A ranger’s talents and abilities are honed with deadly

focus on the grim task of protecting the borderlands.

### Independent Adventurers

Though a ranger might make a living as a hunter, a

guide, or a tracker, a ranger’s true calling is to defend

the outskirts of civilization from the ravages of monsters

and humanoid hordes that press in from the wild.

In

som e places, rangers gather in secretive orders or join

forces with druidic circles.

Many rangers, though, are

independent almost to a fault, knowing that, when a

dragon or a band of orc s attacks, a ranger might be the

first—and possibly the last—line ofdefense.

This fierce independence makes rangers well suited

to adventuring, since the y are accustom ed to life far

from the com forts of a dry bed and a hot bath.

Faced

with city-bred adventurers w ho grouse and whine about

the hardships of the wild, rangers respond with som e

mixture ofamusement, frustration, and com passion.

But the y quickly learn that other adventurers who can

carry the ir own weight in a fight against civilization’s

foes are worth any extra burden.

Coddled city folk might

not know how to feed the mselves or find fresh water in

the wild, but the y make up for it in other ways.

Cre atin gaR ang e r

As you create you r ranger character, consider the nature

of the training that gave you you r particular capabilities.

Did you train with a single mentor, wandering the wilds

together until you mastered the ranger’s ways?

Did you

leave you r apprenticeship, or w as you r mentor slain—

perhaps by the same kind of monster that becam e you r

favored enemy?

Or perhaps you learned you r skills as

part of a band of rangers affiliated with a druidic circle,

trained in mystic paths as well as wilderness lore.

You

might be self-taught, a recluse who learned combat

skills, tracking, and even a magical connection to nature

through the necessity of surviving in the wilds.

W hat’s the source of you r particular hatred of a

certain kind of enemy?

Did a monster kill som eone

you loved or destroy you r hom e village?

Or did you see

too much of the destruction the se monsters cause and

com m it you rself to reining in the ir depredations?

Is

you r adventuring career a continuation of you r work

in protecting the borderlands, or a significant change?

W hat made you join up with a band of adventurers?

Doyou find it challenging to teach new allies the ways

of the wild, or do you w elcom e the relief from solitude

that the y offer?

### Quick Build

You can make a ranger quickly by following the se

By the time you reach 2nd level, you have learned to

as a druid does.

See chapter 10 for the general rules of

spellcasting and chapter 11 for the ranger spell list.

The Ranger table show s how many spell slots you have

to cast you r spells of 1st level and higher.

To cast one of

the se spells, you must expend a slot of the spell’s level

or higher.

You regain all expended spell slots when you

finish a long rest.

For example, if you know the 1st-level spell animal

friendship and have a 1st-level and a 2nd-level spell slot

available, you can cast animal friendship using either slot.

Spe lls Kno wno f 1s tLe vel and Hig her

You know two 1st-level spells of you r choice from the

monsters you have encountered on you r adventures.

### Natural Explorer

spell slots.

For instance, when you reach 5th level in this

class, you can learn one new spell of 1st or 2nd level.

Additionally, when you gain a level in this class,

you can choose one of the ranger spells you know

and replace it with another spell from the ranger

spell list, which also must be of a level for which you

have spell slots.

### Spellcasting Ability

W isdom is you r spellcasting ability for you r ranger

spells, since you r m agic draws on you r attunement to

nature.

You use you r W isdom when ever a spell refers

to you r spellcasting ability.

In addition, you use you r

W isdom modifier when setting the saving throw DC for

a ranger spell you cast and when making an attack roll

with one.

Spell save DC = 8 + you r proficiency bonus +

you r Wisdom modifier

Spell attack modifier = you r proficiency bonus +

you r Wisdom modifier

you features at 3rd level and again at 7th, 11th,

and 15th level.

### Primeval Awareness

expend one ranger spell slot to focus you r awareness on

the region around you.

For 1 minute per level of the spell

slot you expend, you can sense whether the following

types of creatures are present with in 1 mile of you (or

with in up to 6 miles if you are in you r favored terrain):

aberrations, celestials, dragons, elementals, fey, fiends,

and undead.

This feature doesn’t reveal the creatures’

location or number.

### Ability Score Improvement

W hen you reach 4th level, and again at 8th, 12th, 16th,

and 19th level, you can increase one ability score of you r

As normal, you can’t increase an ability

### Extra Attack

Beginning at 5th level, you can attack twice, instead of

once, when ever you take the Attack action on you r turn.

Lan d ’sSt rid e

Starting at 8th level, moving through nonmagical

difficult terrain costs you no extra movement.

You can

also pass through nonm agical plants with out being

slowed by the m and with out taking damage from the m if

In addition, you have advantage on saving throws

against plants that are magically created or manipulated

to im pede movement, such those created by the

entangle spell.

such as a tree or wall, that is at least as tall and wide

as you are.

You gain a +10 bonus to Dexterity (Stealth)

nonm agical means, unless you choose to leave a trail.

### Feral Senses

creature you can’t see, you r inability to see it doesn’t

im pose disadvantage on you r attack rolls against it.

creature with in 30 feet of you, provided that the

creature isn’t hidden from you and you aren’t

blinded or deafened.

enemies.

You can choose to use this feature before or after the

roll, but before any effects of the roll are applied.

### Ranger Archetypes

The ideal ofthe ranger has two classic expressions: the

Hunter and the Beast Master.

### Hunter

Emulating the Hunter archetype means accepting you r

place as a bulwark between civilization and the terrors

of the wilderness.

you face, from rampaging ogres and hordes of orcs to

towering giants and terrifying dragons.

You can deal this

extra damage only once per turn.

You can use you r action to make a ranged

attack against any num ber of creatures with in 10 feet

you make a separate attack roll for each target.

another creature (other than itself) of you r choice.

W hen an attacker that you can see

hits you with an attack, you can use you r reaction to

halve the attack’s damage against you.

### Beast Master

The Beast Master archetype em bodies a friendship

between the civilized races and the beasts of the world.

United in focus, beast and ranger w ork as one to fight

the monstrous foes that threaten civilization and the

wilderness alike.

Emulating the Beast Master archetype

means committing you rself to this ideal, working in

partnership with an animal as its com panion and friend.

Ran ger ’sCo mpa nio n

At 3rd level, you gain a beast com panion that

accom panies you on you r adventures and is trained to

fight alongside you.

Choose a beast that is no larger than

Medium and that has a challenge rating of 1/4 or lower

(appendix D presents statistics for the hawk, mastiff,

and panther as examples).

Add you r proficiency bonus

to the beast’s AC, attack rolls, and damage rolls, as well

as to any saving throws and skills it is proficient in.

Its

hit point maximum equals its norm al maximum or four

times you r ranger level, whichever is higher.

The beast obeys you r com m and s as best as it can.

It

takes its turn on you r initiative, though it doesn’t take an

action unless you com m and it to.

On you r turn, you can

required by you).

You can use you r action to verbally

com m and it to take the Attack, Dash, Disengage, Dodge,

bonus action to com m and the beast to take the Dash,

Disengage, Dodge, or Help action on its turn.

### Bestial Fury

Starting at 11th level, you r beast com panion can

make two attacks when you com m and it to use the

Attack action.

### Share Spells

Beginning at 15th level, when you cast a spell targeting

you rself, you can also affect you r beast com panion with

the spell if the beast is with in 30 feet of you.

Rogues devote as much effort to mastering the use of

a variety of skills as the y do to perfecting the ir combat

abilities, giving the m a broad expertise that few other

characters can match.

Many rogues focus on stealth and

deception, while others refine the skills that help the m

in a dungeon environment, such as climbing, finding and

disarming traps, and opening locks.

W hen it com es to combat, rogues prioritize cunning

over brute strength.

A rogue would rather make one

precise strike, placing it exactly where the attack will

hurt the target most, than w ear an opponent down

with a barrage of attacks.

Rogues have an almost

supernatural knack for avoiding danger, and a few learn

magical tricks to supplement the ir other abilities.

ASh ady Liv ing

Every town and city has its share of rogues.

Most of

the m live up to the worst stereotypes of the class,

making a living as burglars, assassins, cutpurses, and

con artists.

Often, the se scoundrels are organized

into thieves’ guilds or crim e families.

Plenty of rogues

operate independently, but even the y som etim es

recruit apprentices to help the m in the ir scam s

and heists.

A few rogues make an honest living as

### Skilland Precision

Signaling for her com panions to wait, a halfling creeps

forward through the dungeon hall.

She presses an ear

to the door, the n pulls out a set of tools and picks the

lock in the blink of an eye.

Then she disappears into

the shadows as her fighter friend m oves forward to kick

the door open.

A human lurks in the shadows of an alley while his

accom plice prepares for her part in the ambush.

When

the ir target—a notorious slaver—passes the alleyway,

the accom plice cries out, the slaver com es to investigate,

and the assassin’s blade cuts his throat before he can

make a sound.

Suppressing a giggle, a gnom e waggles her fingers

and magically lifts the key ring from the guard’s belt.

In a moment, the keys are in her hand, the cell door is

open, and she and her com panions are free to make

the ir escape.

Rogues rely on skill, stealth, and the ir foes’

vulnerabilities to get the upper hand in any situation.

They have a knack for finding the solution to just about

any problem, demonstrating a resourcefulness and

versatility that is the cornerstone of any successful

adventuring party.

locksmiths, investigators, or exterminators, which can

be a dangerous job in a world where dire rats—and

were rats—haunt the sewers.

As adventurers, rogues fall on both sides of the law.

S om e are hardened crim inals w ho decide to seek

the ir fortune in treasure hoards, while others take up

a life of adventure to escape from the law.

Som e have

learned and perfected the ir skills with the explicit

purpose of infiltrating ancient ruins and hidden crypts

in search of treasure.

### Creatinga Rogue

As you create you r rogue character, consider the

character’s relationship to the law.

Do you have a

criminal past—or present?

Are you on the run from the

law or from an angry thieves’ guild master?

Or did you

leave you r guild in search of bigger risks and bigger

rewards?

Is it greed that drives you in you r adventures,

or som e other desire or ideal?

What w as the trigger that led you away from you r

previous life?

Did a great con or heist gone terribly

w rong cause you to reevaluate you r career?

Maybe

you w ere lucky and a successful robbery gave you the

coin you needed to escape the squalor of you r life.

Did wanderlust finally call you away from you r home?

Perhaps you suddenly found you rself cut off from you r

family or you r mentor, and you had to find a new means

of support.

Or maybe you made a new friend—another

m em ber of you r adventuring party—who showed you

new possibilities for earning a living and employing

you r particular talents.

Make

Intelligence you r next-highest if you want to

## Equipment

### Expertise

You start with the following equipment, in addition to

the equipment granted by you r background:

• (a) a rapier or (b) a shortsword

• (a) a shortbow and quiver of 20 arrows or (b) a

shortsword

• (a) a burglar’s pack, (b) a dungeoneer’s pack, or (c) an

explorer’s pack

• Leather armor, two daggers, and thieves’ tools

At 1st level, choose two of you r skill proficiencies, or

one of you r skill proficiencies and you r proficiency with

thieves’ tools.

Your proficiency bonus is doubled for any

ability check you make that uses either of the chosen

proficiencies.

At 6th level, you can choose two m ore of you r

proficiencies (in skills or with thieves’ tools) to gain

this benefit.

### Sneak Attack

Beginning at 1st level, you know how to strike subtly

and exploit a foe’s distraction.

Once per turn, you can

deal an extra 1d6 damage to one creature you hit with

an attack if you have advantage on the attack roll.

The

attack must use a finesse or a ranged weapon.

You don’t need advantage on the attack roll if another

enemy of the target is with in 5 feet of it, that enemy

isn’t incapacitated, and you don’t have disadvantage on

the attack roll.

The amount of the extra damage increases as you

gain levels in this class, as shown in the Sneak Attack

colum n of the Rogue table.

Thi eve s ’ Can t

During you r rogue training you learned thieves’ cant, a

secret m ix of dialect, jargon, and code that allows you to

hide m essages in seem ingly normal conversation.

Only

another creature that knows thieves’ cant understands

such m essages.

It takes four times longer to convey such

amessage than it does to speak the sam e idea plainly.

In addition, you understand a set of secret signs and

sym bols used to convey short, simple m essages, such

as whether an area is dangerous or the territory of a

thieves’ guild, whether loot is nearby, or whether the

people in an area are easy marks or will provide a safe

house for thieves on the run.

### Cunning Action

Starting at 2nd level, you r quick thinking and agility

allow you to move and act quickly.

You can take a

bonus action on each of you r turns in combat.

This

action can be used only to take the Dash, Disengage,

or Hide action.

### Roguish Archetype

At 3rd level, you choose an archetype that you emulate

in the exercise of you r rogue abilities: Thief, Assassin,

or Arcane Trickster, all detailed at the end of the class

description.

Your archetype choice grants you features

at 3rd level and the n again at 9th, 13th, and 17th level.

### Ability Score Improvement

W hen you reach 4th level, and again at 8th, 10th, 12th,

16th, and 19th level, you can increase one ability score

of you r choice by 2, or you can increase two ability

scores of you r choice by 1.

As normal, you can’t increase

an ability score above 20 using this feature.

### Uncanny Dodge

Starting at 5th level, when an attacker that you can see

hits you with an attack, you can use you r reaction to

halve the attack’s damage against you.

### Evasion

Beginning at 7th level, you can nimbly dodge out ofthe

way of certain area effects, such as a red dragon’s fiery

breath or an ice storm spell.

W hen you are subjected

to an effect that allows you to make a Dexterity saving

throw to take only half damage, you instead take no

damage if you succeed on the saving throw, and only

half damage if you fail.

### Reliable Talent

By 11th level, you have refined you r chosen skills until

the y approach perfection.

W henever you make an ability

check that lets you add you r proficiency bonus, you can

treat a d20 roll of 9 or lower as a 10.

### Blindsense

Starting at 14th level, if you are able to hear, you are

aware of the location of any hidden or invisible creature

with in 10 feet of you.

### Slippery Mind

By 15th level, you have acquired greater mental

strength.

You gain proficiency in W isdom saving throws.

### Elusive

Beginning at 18th level, you are so evasive that

attackers rarely gain the upper hand against you.

No

attack roll has advantage against you while you aren’t

incapacitated.

### Strokeof Luck

At 20th level, you have an uncanny knack for succeeding

when you need to.

If you r attack m isses a target with in

range, you can turn the m iss into a hit.

Alternatively, if

you fail an ability check, you can treat the d20 roll as a 20.

Once you use this feature, you can’t use it again until

you finish a short or long rest.

Rog u is hAr che typ e s

R ogues have many features in com m on, including the ir

emphasis on perfecting the ir skills, the ir precise and

deadly approach to combat, and the ir increasingly quick

reflexes.

But different rogues steer those talents in

varying directions, em bodied by the rogue archetypes.

Your choice of archetype is a reflection of you r focus—

not necessarily an indication of you r chosen profession,

but a description of you r preferred techniques.

### Thief

You hone you r skills in the larcenous arts.

Burglars,

bandits, cutpurses, and other crim inals typically follow

this archetype, but so do rogues who prefer to think of

the mselves as professional treasure seekers, explorers,

delvers, and investigators.

In addition to improving you r

agility and stealth, you learn skills useful for delving into

ancient ruins, reading unfamiliar languages, and using

magic items you normally couldn’t employ.

Fa stH and s

Starting at 3rd level, you can use the bonus action

granted by you r Cunning Action to make a Dexterity

(Sleight of Hand) check, use you r thieves’ tools to

disarm a trap or open a lock, or take the Use an

Object action.

Sec ond - Sto ryW ork

W hen you choose this archetype at 3rd level, you gain

the ability to climb faster than normal; climbing no

longer costs you extra movement.

In addition, when you make a running jump, the

distance you cover increases by a num ber of feet equal

to you r Dexterity modifier.

Su pre meS nea k

Starting at 9th level, you have advantage on a Dexterity

(Stealth) check if you move no m ore than half you r

speed on the same turn.

U se Mag icD evi c e

By 13th level, you have learned enough about the

workings of magic that you can improvise the use of

items even when the y are not intended for you.

You

ignore all class, race, and level requirements on the use

of magic items.

Thi e f ’sRe fle xes

W hen you reach 17th level, you have becom e adept at

laying am bushes and quickly escaping danger.

You can

take two turns during the first round of any combat.

You

take you r first turn at you r normal initiative and you r

second turn at you r initiative minus 10.

You can’t use

this feature when you are surprised.

### Assassin

You focus you r training on the grim art of death.

Those

who adhere to this archetype are diverse: hired killers,

spies, bounty hunters, and even specially anointed

priests trained to exterminate the enem ies of the ir deity.

Stealth, poison, and disguise help you eliminate you r

foes with deadly efficiency.

### Bonus Proficiencies

W hen you choose this archetype at 3rd level, you gain

proficiency with the disguise kit and the poisoner’s kit.

### Assassinate

Starting at 3rd level, you are at you r deadliest when you

in the com bat yet.

In addition, any hit you score against

a creature that is surprised is a critical hit.

### Infiltration Expertise

Starting at 9th level, you can unfailingly create false

identities for you rself.

You must spend seven days and

25 gp to establish the history, profession, and affiliations

for an identity.

You can’t establish an identity that

belongs to som eone else.

For example, you might acquire

appropriate clothing, letters of introduction, and official-

looking certification to establish you rself as a mem ber of

a trading house from a remote city so you can insinuate

you rself into the company of other wealthy merchants.

Thereafter, if you adopt the new identity as a disguise,

other creatures believe you to be that person until given

an obvious reason not to.

### Impostor

At 13th level, you gain the ability to unerringly m imic

another person’s speech, writing, and behavior.

You must spend at least three hours studying

the se three com ponents of the person’s behavior,

listening to speech, examining handwriting, and

observing mannerisms.

### Arcane Trickster

Som e rogues enhance the ir fine-honed skills of stealth

burglars, but also pranksters, mischief-makers, and a

significant number of adventurers.

## Spellcasting

### Mage Hand Legerdemain

W hen you reach 3rd level, you gain the ability to

cast spells.

See chapter 10 for the general rules of

spellcasting and chapter 11 for the w izard spell list.

two other cantrips of you r choice from the wizard spell

list.

You learn another wizard cantrip of you r choice

at 10th level.

Spell Slots.

The Arcane Trickster Spellcasting

table shows how many spell slots you have to cast

you r spells of 1st level and higher.

To cast one of the se

spells, you must expend a slot of the spell's level or

higher.

You regain all expended spell slots when you

finish a long rest.

For example, if you know the 1st-level spell charm

person and have a 1st-level and a 2nd-level spell slot

available, you can cast charm person using either slot.

Spells Known of 1st-Level and Higher.

You know

three 1st-level wizard spells of you r choice, two of which

you must choose from the enchantment and illusion

spells on the w izard spell list.

The Spells Known colum n of the Arcane Trickster

Spellcasting table show s when you learn m ore wizard

spells of 1st level or higher.

Each of the se spells must

be an enchantment or illusion spell of you r choice, and

must be of a level for which you have spell slots.

learn one new spell of 1st or 2nd level.

The spells you learn at 8th, 14th, and 20th level can

com e from any school of magic.

W henever you gain a level in this class, you can

replace one ofthe wizard spells you know with another

spell of you r choice from the wizard spell list.

The

new spell must be of a level for which you have spell

slots, and it must be an enchantment or illusion spell,

unless you’re replacing the spell you gained at 8th, 14th,

or 20th level.

Spellcasting Ability.

Intelligence is you r spellcasting

ability for you r wizard spells, since you learn you r

spells through dedicated study and memorization.

You use you r Intelligence when ever a spell refers to

you r spellcasting ability.

In addition, you use you r

Intelligence modifier when setting the saving throw

DC for a wizard spell you cast and when making an

attack roll with one.

Spell save DC = 8 + you r proficiency bonus +

you r Intelligence modifier

Spell attack modifier = you r proficiency bonus +

you r Intelligence modifier

You can perform one of the se tasks with out being

noticed by a creature if you succeed on a Dexterity

(Sleight of Hand) check contested by the creature’s

W isdom (Perception) check.

In addition, you can use the bonus action granted by

you r Cunning Action to control the hand.

### Magical Ambush

Starting at 9th level, if you are hidden from a

creature when you cast a spell on it, the creature has

disadvantage on any saving throw it makes against the

spell this turn.

### Versatile Trickster

At 13th level, you gain the ability to distract targets with

you r mage hand.

As a bonus action on you r turn, you can

designate a creature with in 5 feet of the spectral hand

created by the spell.

Doing so gives you advantage on

attack rolls against that creature until the end of the turn.

### Spell Thief

At 17th level, you gain the ability to magically

steal the knowledge of how to cast a spell from

another spellcaster.

Immediately after a creature casts a spell that targets

you or includes you in its area of effect, you can use you r

reaction to force the creature to make a saving throw

with its spellcasting ability modifier.

The DC equals

you r spell save DC.

On a failed save, you negate the

spell’s effect against you, and you steal the knowledge

of the spell if it is at least 1st level and of a level you can

cast (it doesn’t need to be a wizard spell).

For the next

8 hours, you know the spell and can cast it using you r

spell slots.

The creature can’t cast that spell until the

8 hours have passed.

Once you use this feature, you can’t use it again until

you finish a long rest.

S or c er er

Golden eyes flashing, a human

stretches out her hand and unleashes

the dragonfire that burns in her veins.

As an inferno rages around her foes,

leathery wings spread from her back and

she takes to the air.

Long hair whipped by a conjured wind,

a half-elf spreads his arms wide and throws

his head back.

Lifting him momentarily off

the ground, a wave of magic surges up in him,

through him, and out from him in a mighty blast

of lightning.

Crouching behind a stalagmite, a halfling points a

finger at a charging troglodyte.

A blast of fire springs

from her finger to strike the creature.

She ducks back

behind the rock formation with a grin, unaware that her

wild magic has turned her skin bright blue.

Sorcerers carry amagical birthright conferred

upon the m by an exotic bloodline, som e otherworldly

influence, or exposure to unknown cosm ic forces.

One can’t study sorcery as one learns a language, any

m ore than one can learn to live a legendary life.

No one

chooses sorcery; the power chooses the sorcerer.

Magic is a part of every sorcerer, suffusing body, mind,

and spirit with a latent power that waits to be tapped.

Som e sorcerers wield magic that springs from an

ancient bloodline infused with the magic of dragons.

Others carry a raw, uncontrolled magic with in the m,

a chaotic storm that manifests in unexpected ways.

The appearance of sorcerous powers is wildly

unpredictable.

Som e draconic bloodlines produce

exactly one sorcerer in every generation, but in other

lines of descent every individual is a sorcerer.

Most

of the time, the talents ofsorcery appear as apparent

flukes.

Som e sorcerers can’t name the origin of the ir

power, while others trace it to strange events in the ir

own lives.

The touch of a demon, the blessing of a

dryad at a baby’s birth, or a taste of the water from

a mysterious spring might spark the gift of sorcery.

Sotoo might the gift of a deity of magic, exposure

to the elemental forces of the Inner Planes or the

maddening chaos of Limbo, or a glimpse into the

inner workings of reality.

Sorcerers have no use for the spellbooks and ancient

tom es of m agic lore that wizards rely on, nor do the y

rely on a patron to grant the ir spells as w arlocks do.

By learning to harness and channel the ir own inborn

magic, the y can discover new and staggering ways

to unleash that power.

### Unexplained Powers

Sorcerers are rare in the world, and it’s unusual to find

a sorcerer w ho is not involved in the adventuring life

in som e way.

People with magical power seething in

the ir veins soon discover that the power doesn’t like to

stay quiet.

A sorcerer’s magic wants to be wielded, and

it has a tendency to spill out in unpredictable ways if

it isn’t called on.

Sorcerers often

have obscure or quixotic

motivations driving the m

to adventure.

Som e seek a greater

understanding of the m agical force that infuses

the m, or the answer to the mystery of its origin.

Others

hope to find a way to get rid of it, or to unleash its full

potential.

Whatever the ir goals, sorcerers are every bit

as useful to an adventuring party as wizards, making

up for a comparative lack of breadth in the ir magical

knowledge with enorm ous flexibility in using the

spells the y know.

### Creatinga Sorcerer

The most important question to consider when creating

you r sorcerer is the origin of you r power.

As a starting

character, you'll choose an origin that ties to a draconic

bloodline or the influence of wild magic, but the exact

source of you r power is up to you to decide.

Is it a family

curse, passed down to you from distant ancestors?

Or

did som e extraordinary event leave you blessed with

inherent magic but perhaps scarred as well?

How do you feel about the magical power coursing

through you?

Doyou em brace it, try to master it, or

revel in its unpredictable nature?

Is it a blessing or

a curse?

Did you seek it out, or did it find you?

Did

you have the option to refuse it, and do you wish you

had?

W hat do you intend to do with it?

Perhaps you

feel like you’ve been given this power for som e lofty

purpose.

Or you might decide that the power gives you

the right to do what you want, to take what you want

from those who lack such power.

Perhaps you r power

links you to a powerful individual in the world—the fey

creature that blessed you at birth, the dragon who put

a drop of its blood into you r veins, the lich who created

you as an experiment, or the deity who chose you to

carry this power.

### Quick Build

You can make a sorcerer quickly by following the se

suggestions.

First, Charisma should be you r highest

ability score, followed by Constitution.

Second,

choose the hermit background.

Third, choose the

light, prestidigitation, ray of frost, and shocking grasp

cantrips, along with the 1st-level spells shield and

magic missile.

## Spellcasting

### Cantrips

An event in you r past, or in the life of a parent or

arcane magic.

This font of magic, what ever its origin,

fuels you r spells.

spellcasting and chapter 11 for the sorcerer spell list.

At 1st level, you know four cantrips of you r choice from

slots when you finish a long rest.

hands and have a 1st-level and a 2nd-level spell slot

available, you can cast burning hands using either slot.

Spe lls Kno wno f 1s tLe vel and Hig her

or 2nd level.

Additionally, when you gain a level in this class,

you can choose one of the sorcerer spells you know

and replace it with another spell from the sorcerer

spell list, which also must be of a level for which you

have spell slots.

### Spellcasting Ability

spells, since the power of you r m agic relies on you r

ability to project you r will into the world.

Charisma when ever a spell refers to you r spellcasting

ability.

In addition, you use you r Charisma modifier

when setting the saving throw DC for a sorcerer spell

you cast and when making an attack roll with one.

you r Charisma modifier

spellcasting focus for you r sorcerer spells.

W hen you cast a spell that forces other creatures to make

a saving throw, you can protect som e of those creatures

from the spell’s full force.

point and choose a number of those creatures up to you r

Charisma modifier (minimum of one creature).

A chosen

creature automatically succeeds on its saving throw

against the spell.

### Distant Spell

or longer, you can spend 1 sorcery point to double its

duration, to a maximum duration of 24 hours.

At 20th level, you regain 4 expended sorcery points

when ever you finish a short rest.

So rcer ous Orig in s

Different sorcerers claim different origins for the ir

innate magic.

Although many variations exist, most

of the se origins fall into two categories: a draconic

bloodline and wild magic.

### Draconic Bloodline

Your innate magic com es from draconic m agic that was

mingled with you r blood or that ofyour ancestors.

Most

often, sorcerers with this origin trace the ir descent

back to a mighty sorcerer of ancient times w ho made a

bargain with a dragon or who might even have claimed

a dragon parent.

Som e of the se bloodlines are well

established in the world, but most are obscure.

Any

given sorcerer could be the first of a new bloodline, as a

result of a pact or som e other exceptional circumstance.

### Dragon Ancestor

At 1st level, you choose one type of dragon as you r

ancestor.

The damage type associated with each dragon

is used by features you gain later.

### Draconic Ancestry

You can speak, read, and write Draconic.

Additionally,

when ever you make a Charisma check when interacting

with dragons, you r proficiency bonus is doubled if it

applies to the check.

### Draconic Resilience

As magic flows through you r body, it causes physical

traits of you r dragon ancestors to emerge.

At 1st level,

you r hit point maximum increases by 1 and increases by

1 again when ever you gain a level in this class.

Additionally, parts of you r skin are covered by a thin

sheen of dragon-like scales.

W hen you aren’t wearing

armor, you r AC equals 13 + you r Dexterity modifier.

### Elemental Affinity

Starting at 6th level, when you cast a spell that deals

damage of the type associated with you r draconic

ancestry, add you r Charisma modifier to that damage.

At the same time, you can spend 1 sorcery point to gain

resistance to that damage type for 1 hour.

Dra gon W in g s

At 14th level, you gain the ability to sprout a pair of

dragon wings from you r back, gaining a flying speed

equal to you r current speed.

You can create the se wings

as a bonus action on you r turn.

They last until you

dism iss the m as a bonus action on you r turn.

You can’t manifest you r w ings while wearing armor

unless the armor is made to accom m odate the m, and

clothing not made to accom m odate you r wings might

be destroyed when you manifest the m.

### Draconic Presence

Beginning at 18th level, you can channel the dread

presence of you r dragon ancestor, causing those around

you to becom e awestruck or frightened.

As an action,

you can spend 5 sorcery points to draw on this power

and exude an aura of awe or fear (you r choice) to a

distance of 60 feet.

For 1 minute or until you lose you r

concentration (as if you w ere casting a concentration

spell), each hostile creature that starts its turn in this

aura must succeed on aWisdom saving throw or be

charm ed (if you chose awe) or frightened (if you chose

fear) until the aura ends.

A creature that succeeds on

this saving throw is immune to you r aura for 24 hours.

### Wild Magic

Your innate magic com es from the wild forces of chaos

that underlie the order of creation.

You might have

endured exposure to som e form ofraw magic, perhaps

through a planar portal leading to Limbo, the Elemental

Planes, or the mysterious Far Realm.

Perhaps you

were blessed by a powerful fey creature or marked by a

demon.

Or you r magic could be a fluke of you r birth, with

no apparent cause or reason.

chaotic magic churns with in you, waiting for any outlet.

You

can do so after the creature rolls but before any effects

of the roll occur.

surges of you r wild magic.

### Warlock

With a pseudodragon curled on his shoulder, a you ng

elf in golden robes sm iles warmly, weaving a magical

charm into his honeyed words and bending the palace

sentinel to his will.

As flames spring to life in her hands, a wizened

human whispers the secret name of her dem onic patron,

infusing her spell with fiendish magic.

Shifting his gaze between a battered tome and the

odd alignment of the stars overhead, a wild-eyed tiefling

chants the mystic ritual that will open a doorway to a

distant world.

W arlocks are seekers of the knowledge that lies

hidden in the fabric of the multiverse.

Through pacts

made with mysterious beings of supernatural power,

warlocks unlock m agical effects both subtle and

spectacular.

Drawing on the ancient knowledge of

beings such as fey nobles, dem ons, devils, hags, and

alien entities ofthe Far Realm, warlocks piece together

arcane secrets to bolster the ir own power.

### Swornand Beholden

Awarlock is defined by a pact with an otherworldly

being.

Som etim es the relationship between warlock

and patron is like that of a cleric and a deity, though

the beings that serve as patrons for w arlocks are not

gods.

A warlock might lead a cult dedicated to a demon

prince, an archdevil, or an utterly alien entity—beings

not typically served by clerics.

More often, though, the

arrangement is similar to that between a master and

an apprentice.

The warlock learns and grows in power,

at the cost ofoccasional services perform ed on the

patron’s behalf.

The magic bestowed on awarlock ranges from minor

but lasting alterations to the warlock's being (such as

the ability to see in darkness or to read any language)

to access to powerful spells.

Unlike bookish wizards,

w arlocks supplement the ir magic with som e facility

at hand-to-hand combat.

They are com fortable in light

armor and know how to use simple weapons.

### Delversinto Secrets

W arlocks are driven by an insatiable need for knowledge

and power, which com pels the m into the ir pacts and

shapes the ir lives.

This thirst drives warlocks into the ir

pacts and shapes the ir later careers as well.

Stories of warlocks binding the mselves to fiends are

widely known.

But many warlocks serve patrons that

are not fiendish.

Som etim es a traveler in the wilds

com es to a strangely beautiful tower, meets its fey lord

or lady, and stumbles into a pact with out being fully

aware of it.

And som etim es, while poring over tom es of

forbidden lore, a brilliant but crazed student’s mind is

opened to realities beyond the material world and to the

alien beings that dwell in the outer void.

Once a pact is made, a warlock’s thirst for knowledge

and power can’t be slaked with mere study and research.

No one makes a pact with such a mighty patron if he or

she doesn’t intend to use the power thus gained.

Rather,

the vast majority of warlocks spend the ir days in active

pursuit of the ir goals, which typically means som e kind

of adventuring.

Furthermore, the demands of the ir

patrons drive warlocks toward adventure.

### Creatinga Warlock

As you make you r warlock character, spend som e time

thinking about you r patron and the obligations that

you r pact im poses upon you.

What led you to make the

pact, and how did you make contact with you r patron?

Were you seduced into sum m oning a devil, or did you

seek out the ritual that would allow you to make contact

with an alien elder god?

Did you search for you r patron,

or did you r patron find and choose you?

Do you chafe

under the obligations of you r pact or serve joyfully in

anticipation ofthe rewards prom ised to you?

W ork with you r DM to determine how big a part you r

pact will play in you r character’s adventuring career.

Your patron’s demands might drive you into adventures,

or the y might consist entirely of small favors you can do

between adventures.

W hat kind of relationship do you have with you r

patron?

Is it friendly, antagonistic, uneasy, or romantic?

H ow important does you r patron consider you to be?

What part do you play in you r patron’s plans?

Do you

know other servants of you r patron?

How does you r patron com m unicate with you?

If

you have a familiar, it might occasionally speak with

you r patron’s voice.

Som e warlocks find m essages

from the ir patrons etched on trees, mingled am ong tea

leaves, or adrift in the clouds—m essages that only the

warlock can see.

Other w arlocks converse with the ir

patrons in dream s or waking visions, or deal only with

intermediaries.

### Quick Build

You can make awarlock quickly by following the se

suggestions.

First, Charisma should be you r highest

ability score, followed by Constitution.

Second, choose

the charlatan background.

Third, choose the eldritch

blast and chill touch cantrips, along with the 1st-level

spells ray ofsickness and witch bolt.

C lass Fea tur e s

weapon

• (a) a com ponent pouch or (b) an arcane focus

at the end of the class description.

Your choice

grants you features at 1st level and again at 6th, 10th,

and 14th level.

### Pact Magic

Your arcane research and the magic bestowed on you

by you r patron have given you facility with spells.

See

chapter 10 for the general rules ofspellcasting and

chapter 11 for the w arlock spell list.

### Cantrips

You know two cantrips of you r choice from the warlock

spell list.

You learn additional warlock cantrips of you r

choice at higher levels, as shown in the Cantrips Known

colum n of the W arlock table.

### Spell Slots

The W arlock table shows how many spell slots you have.

The table also shows what the level of those slots is; all

of you r spell slots are the same level.

To cast one of you r

warlock spells of 1st level or higher, you must expend a

spell slot.

You regain all expended spell slots when you

finish a short or long rest.

For example, when you are 5th level, you have

two 3rd-level spell slots.

To cast the 1st-level spell

thunderwave, you must spend one of those slots, and

you cast it as a 3rd-level spell.

Spe lls Kno wno f 1s tLe vel and Hig her

At 1st level, you know two 1st-level spells of you r choice

from the w arlock spell list.

The Spells Known colum n of the W arlock table shows

when you learn m ore w arlock spells of you r choice of 1st

level and higher.

A spell you choose must be of a level

no higher than what’s shown in the table's Slot Level

colum n for you r level.

W hen you reach 6th level, for

example, you learn a new warlock spell, which can be

1st, 2nd, or 3rd level.

Additionally, when you gain a level in this class,

you can choose one of the warlock spells you know

and replace it with another spell from the warlock

spell list, which also must be of a level for which you

have spell slots.

### Spellcasting Ability

Charisma is you r spellcasting ability for you r warlock

spells, so you use you r Charisma when ever a spell refers

to you r spellcasting ability.

In addition, you use you r

Charisma modifier when setting the saving throw DC

for awarlock spell you cast and when making an attack

roll with one.

Spell save DC = 8 + you r proficiency bonus +

you r Charisma modifier

Spell attack modifier = you r proficiency bonus +

you r Charisma modifier

### Spellcasting Focus

You can use an arcane focus (found in chapter 5) as a

spellcasting focus for you r w arlock spells.

### Eldritch Invocations

In you r study of occult lore, you have unearthed eldritch

imbue you with an abiding magical ability.

At 2nd level, you gain two eldritch invocations of you r

Your invocation options are detailed at the end

of the class description.

W hen you gain certain w arlock

levels, you gain additional invocations of you r choice,

as shown in the Invocations Known colum n of the

W arlock table.

Additionally, when you gain a level in this class,

you can choose one of the invocations you know and

replace it with another invocation that you could learn

at that level.

upon you for you r loyal service.

You gain one of the

following features of you r choice.

Pa cto fth eCh ain

You learn the find familiar spell and can cast it as a

ritual.

The spell doesn’t count against you r number of

spells known.

W hen you cast the spell, you can choose one of the

normal form s for you r familiar or one of the following

special forms: imp, pseudodragon, quasit, or sprite.

Additionally, when you take the Attack action, you can

forgo one of you r own attacks to allow you r familiar to

make one attack of its own.

Pa cto fth eBl ade

You can use you r action to create a pact w eapon in you r

empty hand.

You can choose the form that this melee

w eapon takes each time you create it (see chapter 5 for

w eapon options).

You are proficient with it while you

wield it.

This w eapon counts as m agical for the purpose

of overcom ing resistance and immunity to nonm agical

attacks and damage.

Your pact w eapon disappears if it is m ore than 5 feet

away from you for 1 minute or more.

It also disappears

if you use this feature again, if you dism iss the weapon

(no action required), or if you die.

You can transform one magic weapon into you r pact

weapon by perform ing a special ritual while you hold

the weapon.

You perform the ritual over the course

of 1 hour, which can be done during a short rest.

You can the n dism iss the weapon, shunting it into an

extradimensional space, and it appears when ever you

create you r pact weapon the reafter.

You can’t affect an

artifact or a sentient w eapon in this way.

The weapon

ceases being you r pact weapon if you die, if you perform

the 1-hour ritual on a different weapon, or if you use

a 1-hour ritual to break you r bond to it.

The weapon

appears at you r feet if it is in the extradimensional space

when the bond breaks.

Pa cto fth eTo m e

Your patron gives you a grim oire called aBook of

Shadows.

W hen you gain this feature, choose three

cantrips from any class’s spell list.

W hile the book is on

you r person, you can cast those cantrips at will.

They

don’t count against you r number of cantrips known.

If you lose you r B ook of Shadows, you can perform

a 1-hour cerem ony to receive a replacement from you r

patron.

This cerem ony can be perform ed during a short

or long rest, and it destroys the previous book.

The book

turns to ash when you die.

### Ability Score Improvement

W hen you reach 4th level, and again at 8th, 12th, 16th,

and 19th level, you can increase one ability score of you r

choice by 2, or you can increase two ability scores of

you r choice by 1.

As normal, you can't increase an ability

score above 20 using this feature.

### Mystic Arcanum

At 11th level, you r patron bestows upon you a magical

secret called an arcanum.

C hoose one 6th-level spell

from the w arlock spell list as this arcanum.

You can cast you r arcanum spell once with out

expending a spell slot.

You must finish a long rest before

you can do so again.

At higher levels, you gain m ore warlock spells of you r

choice that can be cast in this way: one 7th-level spell

at 13th level, one 8th-level spell at 15th level, and one

9th-level spell at 17th level.

You regain all uses of you r

Mystic Arcanum when you finish a long rest.

### Eldritch Master

At 20th level, you can draw on you r inner reserve of

mystical power while entreating you r patron to regain

expended spell slots.

You can spend 1 minute entreating

you r patron for aid to regain all you r expended spell slots

from you r Pact Magic feature.

Once you regain spell slots

with this feature, you must finish a long rest before you

can do so again.

Yo urPa ctB oon

Each Pact Boon option produces a special creature or an

object that reflects you r patron’s nature.

Pact of the Chain.

Your familiar is more cunning than a

typical familiar.

Its default form can be a reflection of you r

patron, with sprites and pseudodragons tied to the Archfey

and imps and quasits tied to the Fiend.

Because the Great Old

One’s nature is inscrutable, any familiar form is suitable for it.

Pact of the Blade.

If you r patron is the Archfey, you r

weapon might be a slender blade wrapped in leafy vines.

If you serve the Fiend, you r weapon could be an axe made

of black metal and adorned with decorative flames.

If you r

patron is the Great Old One, you r weapon might be an

ancient-looking spear, with a gemstone embedded in its

head, carved to look like a terrible unblinking eye.

Pact of the Tome.

Your Book of Shadows might be a fine,

gilt-edged tome with spells of enchantment and illusion,

gifted to you by the lordly Archfey.

It could be a weighty tome

bound in demon hide studded with iron, holding spells of

conjuration and a wealth of forbidden lore about the sinister

regions of the cosmos, a gift of the Fiend.

Or it could be the

tattered diary of a lunatic driven mad by contact with the

Great Old One, holding scraps of spells that only you r own

burgeoning insanity allows you to understand and cast.

Oth erw orld ly Patro n s

The beings that serve as patrons for w arlocks are

mighty inhabitants of other planes of existence—not

gods, but almost godlike in the ir power.

Various patrons

give the ir w arlocks access to different powers and

invocations, and expect significant favors in return.

Som e patrons collect w arlocks, doling out mystic

knowledge relatively freely or boasting of the ir ability

to bind mortals to the ir will.

Other patrons bestow the ir

power only grudgingly, and might make a pact with

only one warlock.

W arlocks who serve the same patron

might view each other as allies, siblings, or rivals.

### The Archfey

Your patron is a lord or lady of the fey, a creature of

legend who holds secrets that were forgotten before

the mortal races were born.

This being’s motivations

are often inscrutable, and som etim es whimsical, and

might involve a striving for greater magical power or the

settling of age-old grudges.

Beings of this sort include

the Prince of Frost; the Queen of Air and Darkness,

ruler of the Gloam ing Court; Titania of the Sum m er

Court; her consort Oberon, the Green Lord; Hyrsam,

the Prince of Fools; and ancient hags.

### Expanded Spell List

The Archfey lets you choose from an expanded list of

spells when you learn a warlock spell.

The following

spells are added to the w arlock spell list for you.

### Archfey Expanded Spells

ability to project the beguiling and fearsom e presence

of the fey.

As an action, you can cause each creature in

a 10-foot cube originating from you to make aWisdom

saving throw against you r w arlock spell save DC.

The

creatures that fail the ir saving throws are all charm ed

or frightened by you (you r choice) until the end of

you r next turn.

Once you use this feature, you can’t use it again until

you finish a short or long rest.

### Misty Escape

Starting at 6th level, you can vanish in a puff of mist in

response to harm.

W hen you take damage, you can use

you r reaction to turn invisible and teleport up to 60 feet

to an unoccupied space you can see.

You remain invisible

until the start of you r next turn or until you attack or

cast a spell.

Once you use this feature, you can't use it again until

you finish a short or long rest.

### Beguiling Defenses

Beginning at 10th level, you r patron teaches you how to

turn the mind-affecting magic of you r enem ies against

the m.

You are immune to being charmed, and when

another creature attempts to charm you, you can use

you r reaction to attempt to turn the charm back on

that creature.

The creature must succeed on aWisdom

saving throw against you r warlock spell save DC or

be charmed by you for 1 minute or until the creature

takes any damage.

### Dark Delirium

Starting at 14th level, you can plunge a creature into

an illusory realm.

As an action, choose a creature

that you can see with in 60 feet of you.

It must make a

W isdom saving throw against you r warlock spell save

DC.

On a failed save, it is charm ed or frightened by you

(you r choice) for 1 minute or until you r concentration

is broken (as if you are concentrating on a spell).

effect ends early if the creature takes any damage.

Until this illusion ends, the creature thinks it is lost

in a misty realm, the appearance of which you choose.

The creature can see and hear only itself, you, and

the illusion.

You must finish a short or long rest before you can

use this feature again.

forge a pact include dem on lords such as Dem ogorgon,

Orcus, Fraz’Urb-luu, and Baphomet; archdevils such

you finish a long rest.

### The Great Old On

e

Your patron is a mysterious entity w hose nature is

utterly foreign to the fabric of reality.

It might com e from

the Far Realm, the space beyond reality, or it could be

one of the elder gods known only in legends.

Its motives

are incom prehensible to mortals, and its knowledge so

im m ense and ancient that even the greatest libraries

pale in com parison to the vast secrets it holds.

The

Great Old One might be unaware of you r existence

or entirely indifferent to you, but the secrets you have

learned allow you to draw you r magic from it.

Entities of this type include Ghaunadar, called That

W hich Lurks; Tharizdun, the Chained God; Dendar, the

Night Serpent; Zargon, the Returner; Great Cthulhu;

and other unfathomable beings.

W iz ard

Clad in the silver robes that denote her station, an

elf closes her eyes to shut out the distractions of the

battlefield and begins her quiet chant.

Fingers weaving

in front of her, she com pletes her spell and launches a

tiny bead of fire toward the enemy ranks, where it erupts

into a conflagration that engulfs the soldiers.

Checking and rechecking his work, a human scribes

an intricate magic circle in chalk on the bare stone

floor, the n sprinkles powdered iron along every line and

graceful curve.

W hen the circle is complete, he drones a

long incantation.

A hole opens in space inside the circle,

bringing a whiff of brim stone from the otherworldly

plane beyond.

Crouching on the floor in a dungeon intersection, a

gnom e tosses a handful of small bones inscribed with

mystic symbols, muttering a few words of power over

the m.

Closing his eyes to see the visions m ore clearly,

he nods slowly, the n opens his eyes and points down the

passage to his left.

W izards are supreme magic-users, defined and united

as a class by the spells the y cast.

Drawing on the subtle

weave of magic that permeates the cosm os, wizards cast

spells of explosive fire, arcing lightning, subtle deception,

and brute-force mind control.

Their magic conjures

monsters from other planes of existence, glimpses the

future, or turns slain foes into zom bies.

Their mightiest

spells change one substance into another, call meteors

down from the sky, or open portals to other worlds.

### Scholarsofthe Arcane

W ild and enigmatic, varied in form and function, the

power of m agic draws students w ho seek to master

its mysteries.

Som e aspire to becom e like the gods,

shaping reality itself.

Though the casting of a typical

spell requires merely the utterance of a few strange

words, fleeting gestures, and som etim es a pinch or

clump ofexotic materials, the se surface com ponents

barely hint at the expertise attained after years of

apprenticeship and countless hours of study.

W izards live and die by the ir spells.

Everything else

is secondary.

They learn new spells as the y experiment

and grow in experience.

They can also learn the m from

other wizards, from ancient tom es or inscriptions,

and from ancient creatures (such as the fey) that are

steeped in magic.

### The Lureof Knowledge

W izards’ lives are seldom mundane.

The closest a

w izard is likely to com e to an ordinary life is working

as a sage or lecturer in a library or university, teaching

others the secrets of the multiverse.

Other wizards sell

the ir services as diviners, serve in military forces, or

pursue lives of crime or domination.

But the lure ofknowledge and power calls even the

most unadventurous wizards out of the safety of the ir

libraries and laboratories and into crumbling ruins and

lost cities.

M ost w izards believe that the ir counterparts

in ancient civilizations knew secrets of magic that have

been lost to the ages, and discovering those secrets

could unlock the path to a power greater than any magic

available in the present age.

### Creatinga Wizard

Creating a wizard character demands a backstory

dominated by at least one extraordinary event.

How

did you r character first com e into contact with magic?

How did you discover you had an aptitude for it?

Do

you have a natural talent, or did you simply study

hard and practice incessantly?

Did you encounter a

magical creature or an ancient tome that taught you the

basics of magic?

What drew you forth from you r life of study?

Did you r

first taste of m agical knowledge leave you hungry for

more?

Have you received word of a secret repository

of knowledge not yet plundered by any other wizard?

Perhaps you’re simply eager to put you r newfound

magical skills to the test in the face ofdanger.

## Equipment

You start with the following equipment, in addition to

the equipment granted by you r background:

• (a) a quarterstaff or (b) a dagger

• (a) a com ponent pouch or (b) an arcane focus

• (a) a scholar’s pack or (b) an explorer’s pack

• A spellbook

## Spellcasting

### Cantrips

As a student ofarcane magic, you have a spellbook

containing spells that show the first glimm erings of

you r true power.

See chapter 10 for the general rules of

spellcasting and chapter 11 for the wizard spell list.

At 1st level, you know three cantrips of you r choice

from the wizard spell list.

You learn additional wizard

cantrips of you r choice at higher levels, as shown in the

Cantrips Known colum n of the W izard table.

### Your Spellbook

The spells that you add to you r spellbook as you gain levels

reflect the arcane research you conduct on you r own, as well

as intellectual breakthroughs you have had about the nature

of the multiverse.

You might find other spells during you r

adventures.

You could discover a spell recorded on a scroll in

an evil wizard's chest, for example, or in a dusty tome in an

ancient library.

Copying a Spell into the Book.

When you find a wizard spell

of 1st level or higher, you can add it to you r spellbook if it is

of a level for which you have spell slots and if you can spare

the time to decipher and copy it.

Copying a spell into you r spellbook involves reproducing

the basic form of the spell, the n deciphering the unique

system of notation used by the wizard who wrote it.

You

must practice the spell until you understand the sounds

or gestures required, the n transcribe it into you r spellbook

using you r own notation.

For each level of the spell, the process takes 2 hours and

costs 50 gp.

The cost represents material components you

expend as you experiment with the spell to master it, as well

as the fine inks you need to record it.

Once you have spent

this time and money, you can prepare the spell just like you r

other spells.

Replacing the Book.

You can copy a spell from you r own

spellbook into another book— for example, if you want

to make a backup copy of you r spellbook.

This is just like

copying a new spell into you r spellbook, but faster and easier,

since you understand you r own notation and already know

how to cast the spell.

You need spend only 1 hour and 10 gp

for each level of the copied spell.

If you lose you r spellbook, you can use the same procedure

to transcribe the spells that you have prepared into a new

spellbook.

Filling out the remainder of you r spellbook

requires you to find new spells to do so, as normal.

For this

reason, many wizards keep backup spellbooks in a safe place.

The Book’s Appearance.

Your spellbook is a unique

compilation of spells, with its own decorative flourishes and

margin notes.

It might be a plain, functional leather volume

that you received as a gift from you r master, a finely bound

gilt-edged tome you found in an ancient library, or even a

loose collection of notes scrounged together after you lost

you r previous spellbook in a mishap.

### Spellbook

At 1st level, you have a spellbook containing six 1st-level

wizard spells of you r choice.

### Preparingand Casting Spells

The W izard table shows how many spell slots you have

to cast you r spells of 1st level and higher.

To cast one of

the se spells, you must expend a slot of the spell’s level

or higher.

You regain all expended spell slots when you

finish a long rest.

You prepare the list of wizard spells that are available

for you to cast.

To do so. choose a number of wizard

spells from you r spellbook equal to you r Intelligence

modifier + you r wizard level (minimum of one spell).

The

spells must be of a level for which you have spell slots.

For example, if you're a 3rd-level wizard, you have

four 1st-level and two 2nd-level spell slots.

With an

Intelligence o f 16, you r list of prepared spells can

include six spells of 1st or 2nd level, in any combination,

chosen from you r spellbook.

If you prepare the 1st-level

spell magic missile, you can cast it using a 1st-level or a

2nd-level slot.

Casting the spell doesn’t remove it from

you r list of prepared spells.

You can change you r list of prepared spells when

you finish a long rest.

Preparing a new list of wizard

spells requires time spent studying you r spellbook and

m em orizing the incantations and gestures you must

make to cast the spell: at least 1 minute per spell level

for each spell on you r list.

### Spellcasting Ability

Intelligence is you r spellcasting ability for you r wizard

spells, since you learn you r spells through dedicated

study and memorization.

You use you r Intelligence

when ever a spell refers to you r spellcasting ability.

In addition, you use you r Intelligence m odifier when

setting the saving throw DC for a wizard spell you cast

and when making an attack roll with one.

Spell save DC = 8 + you r proficiency bonus +

you r Intelligence modifier

Spell attack modifier = you r proficiency bonus +

you r intelligence modifier

### Ritual Casting

You can cast a wizard spell as a ritual if that spell has

the ritual tag and you have the spell in you r spellbook.

You don't need to have the spell prepared.

### Spellcasting Focus

You can use an arcane focus (found in chapter 5) as a

spellcasting focus for you r wizard spells.

Lea rni ngS pel lso f 1s tLe vel and Hig her

Each time you gain awizard level, you can add two

wizard spells of you r choice to you r spellbook.

Each

of the se spells must be of a level for which you have

spell slots, as shown on the W izard table.

On you r

adventures, you might find other spells that you can add

to you r spellbook (see the “Your Spellbook” sidebar).

### Arcane Recovery

You have learned to regain som e of you r magical energy

by studying you r spellbook.

Once per day when you

finish a short rest, you can choose expended spell slots

to recover.

The spell slots can have a com bined level that

is equal to or less than half you r wizard level (rounded

up), and none of the slots can be 6th level or higher.

For example, if you’re a 4th-level wizard, you can recover

up to two levels worth of spell slots.

You can recover either

a 2nd-level spell slot or two 1st-level spell slots.

### Arcane Tradition

W hen you reach 2nd level, you choose an arcane

tradition, shaping you r practice ofmagic through one

of eight schools: Abjuration, Conjuration, Divination,

Enchantment, Evocation, Illusion, Necromancy,

or Transmutation, all detailed at the end of the

class description.

Your choice grants you features at 2nd level and again

at 6th, 10th, and 14th level.

### Ability Score Improvement

W hen you reach 4th level, and again at 8th, 12th, 16th,

and 19th level, you can increase one ability score of you r

choice by 2, or you can increase two ability scores of

you r choice by 1.

As normal, you can’t increase an ability

score above 20 using this feature.

### Spell Mastery

At 18th level, you have achieved such mastery over

certain spells that you can cast the m at will.

C hoose a

1st-level w izard spell and a 2nd-level wizard spell that

are in you r spellbook.

You can cast those spells at the ir

lowest level with out expending a spell slot when you

have the m prepared.

If you want to cast either spell at a

higher level, you must expend a spell slot as normal.

By spending 8 hours in study, you can exchange one

or both ofthe spells you chose for different spells of

the sam e levels.

### Signature Spells

W hen you reach 20th level, you gain mastery over two

powerful spells and can cast the m with little effort.

Choose two 3rd-level wizard spells in you r spellbook

as you r signature spells.

You always have the se spells

prepared, the y don’t count against the number of spells

you have prepared, and you can cast each of the m once at

3rd level with out expending a spell slot.

W hen you do so,

you can’t do so again until you finish a short or long rest.

If you want to cast either spell at a higher level, you

must expend a spell slot as normal.

Arc ane Tra d it io n s

The study of wizardry is ancient, stretching back to

the earliest mortal discoveries of magic.

It is firmly

established in the worlds of D&D, with various

traditions dedicated to its com plex study.

The most com m on arcane traditions in the multiverse

revolve around the schools of magic.

W izards through

the ages have cataloged thousands of spells, grouping

the m into eight categories called schools, as described

in chapter 10.

In som e places, the se traditions are

literally schools; awizard might study at the School of

Illusion while another studies across town at the School

of Enchantment.

In other institutions, the schools are

m ore like academ ic departments, with rival faculties

com peting for students and funding.

Even w izards who

train apprentices in the solitude of the ir own towers use

the division of magic into schools as a learning device,

since the spells of each school require mastery of

different techniques.

### Schoolof Abjuration

The School of Abjuration em phasizes magic that blocks,

banishes, or protects.

Detractors of this school say

that its tradition is about denial, negation rather than

positive assertion.

You understand, however, that ending

harmful effects, protecting the weak, and banishing evil

influences is anything but a philosophical void.

It is a

proud and respected vocation.

Called abjurers, m em bers of this school are sought

when baleful spirits require exorcism , when important

locations must be guarded against magical spying, and

when portals to other planes of existence must be closed.

Abj ura tio n Sa van t

Beginning when you select this school at 2nd level, the

gold and time you must spend to copy an abjuration

spell into you r spellbook is halved.

### Arcane Ward

Starting at 2nd level, you can weave magic around

you rself for protection.

W hen you cast an abjuration

spell of 1st level or higher, you can simultaneously use a

strand of the spell’s magic to create a magical ward on

you rself that lasts until you finish a long rest.

The ward

has hit points equal to twice you r wizard level + you r

Intelligence modifier.

W henever you take damage, the

ward takes the damage instead.

If this damage reduces

the ward to 0 hit points, you take any remaining damage.

W hile the ward has 0 hit points, it can’t absorb

damage, but its magic remains.

W henever you cast an

abjuration spell of 1st level or higher, the ward regains a

number of hit points equal to twice the level of the spell.

Once you create the ward, you can't create it again

until you finish a long rest.

### Projected Ward

Starting at 6th level, when a creature that you can see

with in 30 feet of you takes damage, you can use you r

reaction to cause you r Arcane Ward to absorb that

damage.

If this damage reduces the ward to 0 hit points,

the warded creature takes any remaining damage.

### Improved Abjuration

Beginning at 10th level, when you cast an abjuration

spell that requires you to make an ability check as

a part of casting that spell (as in counterspell and

dispel magic), you add you r proficiency bonus to that

ability check.

### Spell Resistance

Starting at 14th level, you have advantage on saving

throws against spells.

Furthermore, you have resistance against the

damage of spells.

### Schoolof Conjuration

As a conjurer, you favor spells that produce objects

and creatures out ofthin air.

You can conjure billowing

clouds of killing fog or sum m on creatures from

elsewhere to fight on you r behalf.

As you r mastery

grows, you learn spells of transportation and can

teleport you rself across vast distances, even to other

planes of existence, in an instant.

### Conjuration Savant

Beginning when you select this school at 2nd level, the

gold and time you must spend to copy a conjuration spell

into you r spellbook is halved.

### Minor Conjuration

Starting at 2nd level when you select this school, you

can use you r action to conjure up an inanimate object

in you r hand or on the ground in an unoccupied space

that you can see with in 10 feet of you.

This object can be

no larger than 3 feet on a side and weigh no m ore than

10 pounds, and its form must be that of a nonm agical

object that you have seen.

The object is visibly magical,

radiating dim light out to 5 feet.

The object disappears after 1 hour, when you use this

feature again, or if it takes any damage.

### Benign Transposition

Starting at 6th level, you can use you r action to teleport

up to 30 feet to an unoccupied space that you can see.

Alternatively, you can choose a space with in range

that is occupied by a Small or M edium creature.

If that

creature is will ing, you both teleport, swapping places.

Once you use this feature, you can’t use it again until

you finish a long rest or you cast a conjuration spell of

1st level or higher.

### Focused Conjuration

Beginning at 10th level, while you are concentrating on

a conjuration spell, you r concentration can’t be broken

as a result of taking damage.

### Durable Summons

Starting at 14th level, any creature that you

sum m on or create with a conjuration spell has 30

temporary hit points.

### Schoolof Divination

The counsel of a diviner is sought by royalty and

com m oners alike, for all seek a clearer understanding

of the past, present, and future.

As a diviner, you strive

to part the veils of space, time, and consciousness so

that you can see clearly.

You work to master spells of

discernment, remote viewing, supernatural knowledge,

and foresight.

Div ina tio n Sa van t

Beginning when you select this school at 2nd level, the

gold and time you must spend to copy a divination spell

into you r spellbook is halved.

### Portent

Starting at 2nd level when you choose this school,

glim pses of the future begin to press in on you r

awareness.

W hen you finish a long rest, roll two d20s

and record the numbers rolled.

You can replace any

attack roll, saving throw, or ability check made by you or

a creature that you can see with one of the se foretelling

rolls.

You must choose to do so before the roll, and you

can replace a roll in this way only once per turn.

Each foretelling roll can be used only once.

W hen you

finish a long rest, you lose any unused foretelling rolls.

### Expert Divination

Beginning at 6th level, casting divination spells com es

so easily to you that it expends only a fraction of you r

spellcasting efforts.

W hen you cast a divination spell

of 2nd level or higher using a spell slot, you regain one

expended spell slot.

The slot you regain must be of a

level lower than the spell you cast and can’t be higher

than 5th level.

### The Third Eye

Starting at 10th level, you can use you r action to

increase you r powers ofperception.

W hen you do so,

choose one of the following benefits, which lasts until

you are incapacitated or you take a short or long rest.

You can’t use the feature again until you finish a rest.

Darkvision.

You gain darkvision out to a range of 60

feet, as described in chapter 8.

Ethereal Sight.

You can see into the Ethereal Plane

with in 60 feet of you.

Greater Comprehension.

You can read any language.

See Invisibility.

You can see invisible creatures and

objects with in 10 feet of you that are with in line of sight.

### Greater Portent

Starting at 14th level, the visions in you r dreams

intensify and paint amore accurate picture in you r mind

of what is to com e.

You roll three d20s for you r Portent

feature, rather than two.

### Schoolof Enchantment

As amem ber of the School of Enchantment, you have

honed you r ability to magically entrance and beguile

other people and monsters.

Som e enchanters are

peacem akers w ho bewitch the violent to lay down the ir

arms and charm the cruel into showing mercy.

Others

are tyrants w ho magically bind the unwilling into the ir

service.

Most enchanters fall som ewhere in between.

Enc han tme ntSa van t

Beginning when you select this school at 2nd level, the

gold and time you must spend to copy an enchantment

spell into you r spellbook is halved.

### Hypnotic Gaze

Starting at 2nd level when you choose this school, you r

soft w ords and enchanting gaze can magically enthrall

another creature.

As an action, choose one creature that

you can see with in 5 feet of you.

If the target can see or

hear you, it must succeed on aWisdom saving throw

against you r wizard spell save DC or be charm ed by you

until the end of you r next turn.

The charm ed creature’s

speed drops to 0, and the creature is incapacitated and

visibly dazed.

On subsequent turns, you can use you r action to

maintain this effect, extending its duration until the

end of you r next turn.

However, the effect ends if you

move m ore than 5 feet away from the creature, if the

creature can neither see nor hear you, or if the creature

takes damage.

Once the effect ends, or if the creature succeeds on its

initial saving throw against this effect, you can’t use this

feature on that creature again until you finish a long rest.

### Instinctive Charm

Beginning at 6th level, when a creature you can see

with in 30 feet of you makes an attack roll against

you, you can use you r reaction to divert the attack,

provided that another creature is with in the attack’s

range.

The attacker must make aWisdom saving throw

against you r wizard spell save DC.

On a failed save,

the attacker must target the creature that is closest

to it, not including you or itself.

If multiple creatures

are closest, the attacker chooses which one to target.

On a successful save, you can’t use this feature on the

attacker again until you finish a long rest.

You must choose to use this feature before knowing

whether the attack hits or m isses.

Creatures that can’t

be charm ed are immune to this effect.

### Split Enchantment

Starting at 10th level, when you cast an enchantment

spell of 1st level or higher that targets only one creature,

you can have it target a second creature.

### Alter Memories

At 14th level, you gain the ability to make a creature

unaware of you r magical influence on it.

W hen you cast

an enchantment spell to charm one or m ore creatures,

you can alter one creature’s understanding so that it

remains unaware of being charmed.

Additionally, once before the spell expires, you can

use you r action to try to make the chosen creature

forget som e of the time it spent charmed.

The creature

must succeed on an Intelligence saving throw against

you r wizard spell save DC or lose a number of hours

of its m em ories equal to 1 + you r Charisma modifier

(minimum 1).

You can make the creature forget less

time, and the amount of time can’t exceed the duration

of you r enchantment spell.

### Schoolof Evocation

You focus you r study on magic that creates powerful

elemental effects such as bitter cold, searing flame,

rolling thunder, crackling lightning, and burning acid.

Som e evokers find employment in military forces,

serving as artillery to blast enemy armies from afar.

Others use the ir spectacular power to protect the weak,

while som e seek the ir own gain as bandits, adventurers,

or aspiring tyrants.

Evo cat ion Sa van t

Beginning when you select this school at 2nd level, the

gold and time you must spend to copy an evocation spell

into you r spellbook is halved.

### Sculpt Spells

Beginning at 2nd level, you can create pockets of

relative safety with in the effects of you r evocation spells.

W hen you cast an evocation spell that affects other

creatures that you can see, you can choose a number

of the m equal to 1 + the spell’s level.

The chosen

creatures automatically succeed on the ir saving throws

against the spell, and the y take no damage if the y would

normally take half damage on a successful save.

### Potent Cantrip

Starting at 6th level, you r damaging cantrips affect

even creatures that avoid the brunt of the effect.

W hen

a creature succeeds on a saving throw against you r

cantrip, the creature takes half the cantrip’s damage (if

any) but suffers no additional effect from the cantrip.

### Empowered Evocation

Beginning at 10th level, you can add you r Intelligence

m odifier to the damage roll of any wizard evocation

spell you cast.

### Overchannel

Starting at 14th level, you can increase the power of

you r simpler spells.

W hen you cast a wizard spell of

5th level or lower that deals damage, you can deal

maximum damage with that spell.

The first time you do so, you suffer no adverse effect.

If you use this feature again before you finish a long

rest, you take 2d12 necrotic damage for each level of

the spell, immediately after you cast it.

Each time you

use this feature again before finishing a long rest, the

necrotic damage per spell level increases by 1d 12.

This

damage ignores resistance and immunity.

### Schoolof Illusion

You focus you r studies on magic that dazzles the

senses, befuddles the mind, and tricks even the wisest

folk.

Your magic is subtle, but the illusions crafted by

you r keen mind make the im possible seem real.

Som e

illusionists—including many gnom ewizards—are

benign tricksters w ho use the ir spells to entertain.

Others are m ore sinister masters of deception, using

the ir illusions to frighten and fool others for the ir

personal gain.

Ill usi onSa van t

Beginning when you select this school at 2nd level, the

gold and time you must spend to copy an illusion spell

into you r spellbook is halved.

### Improved Minor Illusion

W hen you choose this school at 2nd level, you learn

the minor illusion cantrip.

If you already know this

cantrip, you learn a different w izard cantrip of you r

choice.

The cantrip doesn’t count against you r number

of cantrips known.

W hen you cast minor illusion, you can create both a

sound and an image with a single casting ofthe spell.

### Malleable Illusions

Starting at 6th level, when you cast an illusion spell that

has a duration of 1 minute or longer, you can use you r

action to change the nature of that illusion (using the

spell’s normal parameters for the illusion), provided that

you can see the illusion.

### Illusory Self

Beginning at 10th level, you can create an illusory

duplicate of you rself as an instant, almost instinctual

reaction to danger.

W hen a creature makes an attack

roll against you, you can use you r reaction to interpose

the illusory duplicate between the attacker and

you rself.

The attack automatically m isses you, the n the

illusion dissipates.

Once you use this feature, you can’t use it again until

you finish a short or long rest.

### Illusory Reality

By 14th level, you have learned the secret of weaving

shadow magic into you r illusions to give the m a sem i-

reality.

W hen you cast an illusion spell of 1st level or

higher, you can choose one inanimate, nonm agical

object that is part of the illusion and make that object

real.

You can do this on you r turn as a bonus action

while the spell is ongoing.

The object remains real for

1 minute.

For example, you can create an illusion of a

bridge over a chasm and the n make it real long enough

for you r allies to cross.

The object can’t deal damage or otherwise

directly harm anyone.

### Schoolof Necromancy

The School of Necrom ancy explores the cosm ic forces

of life, death, and undeath.

As you focus you r studies in

this tradition, you learn to manipulate the energy that

animates all living things.

As you progress, you learn to

sap the life force from a creature as you r magic destroys

its body, transforming that vital energy into magical

power you can manipulate.

Most people see necrom ancers as menacing, or even

villainous, due to the close association with death.

Not all necrom ancers are evil, but the forces the y

manipulate are considered taboo by many societies.

### Necromancy Savant

Beginning when you select this school at 2nd level, the

gold and time you must spend to copy a necrom ancy

spell into you r spellbook is halved.

### Grim Harvest

At 2nd level, you gain the ability to reap life energy from

creatures you kill with you r spells.

Once per turn when

you kill one or m ore creatures with a spell of 1st level

or higher, you regain hit points equal to twice the spell’s

level, or three times its level if the spell belongs to the

School of Necromancy.

You don’t gain this benefit for

killing constructs or undead.

### Undead Thralls

At 6th level, you add the animate dead spell to you r

spellbook if it is not the re already.

W hen you cast

animate dead, you can target one additional corpse

or pile of bones, creating another zom bie or skeleton,

as appropriate.

W henever you create an undead using a necrom ancy

spell, it has additional benefits:

• The creature’s hit point maximum is increased by an

amount equal to you r wizard level.

• The creature adds you r proficiency bonus to its

weapon damage rolls.

### Inuredto Undeath

Beginning at 10th level, you have resistance to necrotic

damage, and you r hit point maximum can't be reduced.

You have spent so much time dealing with undead and

the forces that animate the m that you have becom e

inured to som e of the ir worst effects.

### Command Undead

Starting at 14th level, you can use m agic to bring

undead under you r control, even those created by other

wizards.

As an action, you can choose one undead that

you can see with in 60 feet of you.

That creature must

make a Charisma saving throw against you r wizard

spell save DC.

If it succeeds, you can’t use this feature

on it again.

If it fails, it becom es friendly to you and

obeys you r com m and s until you use this feature again.

Intelligent undead are harder to control in this way.

If the target has an Intelligence of 8 or higher, it has

advantage on the saving throw.

If it fails the saving

throw and has an Intelligence of 12 or higher, it can

repeat the saving throw at the end of every hour until it

succeeds and breaks free.

### Schoolof Transmutation

You are a student of spells that modify energy and matter.

To you, the world is not a fixed thing, but eminently

mutable, and you delight in being an agent of change.

You wield the raw stuff of creation and learn to alter both

physical forms and mental qualities.

Your magic gives

you the tools to becom easmith on reality’s forge.

Som e transmuters are tinkerers and pranksters,

turning people into toads and transforming copper into

silver for fun and occasional profit.

Others pursue the ir

magical studies with deadly seriousness, seeking the

power ofthe gods to make and destroy worlds.

Tra nsm uta tio n Sa van t

Beginning when you select this school at 2nd level, the

gold and time you must spend to copy a transmutation

spell into you r spellbook is halved.

### Minor Alchemy

Starting at 2nd level when you select this school, you

can temporarily alter the physical properties of one

nonm agical object, changing it from one substance into

another.

You perform a special alchemical procedure

on one object com posed entirely of w ood, stone (but not

a gemstone), iron, copper, or silver, transforming it into

a different one of those materials.

For each 10 minutes

you spend perform ing the procedure, you can transform

up to 1 cubic foot of material.

After 1 hour, or until you

lose you r concentration (as if you w ere concentrating on

a spell), the material reverts to its original substance.

Tra nsm ute r ’s St one

Starting at 6th level, you can spend 8 hours creating a

transmuter’s stone that stores transmutation magic.

You

can benefit from the stone you rself or give it to another

creature.

A creature gains a benefit of you r choice

as long as the stone is in the creature’s possession.

W hen you create the stone, choose the benefit from the

following options:

• Darkvision out to a range of 60 feet, as described in

chapter 8

• An increase to speed of 10 feet while the creature is

unencumbered

• Proficiency in Constitution saving throws

• Resistance to acid, cold, fire, lightning, or thunder

damage (you r choice when ever you choose this

benefit)

Each time you cast a transmutation spell of 1st level

or higher, you can change the effect of you r stone if the

stone is on you r person.

If you create a new transmuter’s stone, the previous

one ceases to function.

### Shapechanger

At 10th level, you add the polymorph spell to you r

spellbook, if it is not the re already.

You can cast

polymorph with out expending a spell slot.

W hen you

do so, you can target only you rself and transform into a

beast w hose challenge rating is 1 or lower.

Once you cast polymorph in this way, you can’t do so

again until you finish a short or long rest, though you

can still cast it normally using an available spell slot.

### Master Transmuter

Starting at 14th level, you can use you r action to

consum e the reserve of transmutation magic stored

with in you r transmuter’s stone in a single burst.

W hen

you do so, choose one of the following effects.

Your

transmuter’s stone is destroyed and can’t be remade

until you finish a long rest.

Major Transformation.

You can transmute one

nonm agical object—no larger than a 5-foot cube—into

another nonm agical object of similar size and m ass and

of equal or lesser value.

You must spend 10 minutes

handling the object to transform it.

Panacea.

You remove all curses, diseases, and poisons

affecting a creature that you touch with the transmuter’s

stone.

The creature also regains all its hit points.

Restore Life.

You cast the raise dead spell on a

creature you touch with the transmuter’s stone, with out

expending a spell slot or needing to have the spell in

you r spellbook.

Restore Youth.

You touch the transmuter’s stone to

a will ing creature, and that creature’s apparent age is

reduced by 3 d 10 years, to a minimum of 13 years.

This

effect doesn’t extend the creature’s lifespan.

### Name

CH

ARACTERS ARE DEFINED BY MUCH MORE THAN

the ir race and class.

They’re individuals with

the ir own stories, interests, connections, and

capabilities beyond those that class and race

define.

This chapter expounds on the details

that distinguish characters from one another,

including the basics of name and physical description,

the rules of backgrounds and languages, and the finer

points of personality and alignment.

Cha rac ter Det a il s

Your character’s name and physical description might

be the first things that the other players at the table

learn about you.

It’s worth thinking about how the se

characteristics reflect the character you have in mind.

Your character’s race description includes sample

names for m em bers ofthat race.

Put som e thought into

you r name even if you’re just picking one from a list.

### Sex

You can play a male or female character with out gaining

any special benefits or hindrances.

Think about how

you r character does or does not conform to the broader

culture’s expectations of sex, gender, and sexual

behavior.

For example, a male drow cleric defies the

traditional gender divisions of drow society, which could

be a reason for you r character to leave that society and

com e to the surface.

Tik aan dAr tem i s : Con tra sti ngC har act ers

The details in this chapter make a big difference in setting

you r character apart from every other character.

Consider the

following two human fighters.

Hailing from the Dragonlance setting, Tika Waylan was a

brash teenager who had a rough childhood.

The daughter of

a thief, she ran away from home and practiced her father’s

trade on the streets of Solace.

When she tried to rob the

proprietor of the Inn of the Last Home, he caught her and

took her under his wing, giving her a job as a barmaid.

But

when the dragonarmies laid waste to the town of Solace

and destroyed the inn, necessity forced Tika into adventure

alongside the friends she’d known from her childhood.

Her

skill as a fighter (a frying pan remains one of her favorite

weapons) combined with her history on the streets gave her

skills invaluable in her adventuring career.

Artemis Entreri grew up on the streets of Calimport in the

Forgotten Realms.

He used his wits, strength, and agility

to carve out his own territory in one of the city's hundreds

of poor shanty towns.

After several years, he attracted the

notice of one of the most powerful thieves’ guilds in the city,

and he ascended the ranks of the guild quickly despite his

you th.

Artemis became the favored assassin of one of the

city’s pashas, who sent him to far-off Icewind Dale to recover

some stolen gems.

He’saprofessional killer, constantly

challenging himself to improve his skills.

Tika and Artemis are both human and both fighters (with

some experience as rogues), possessing similarly high

Strength and Dexterity scores, but the re the similarity ends.

You don’t need to be confined to binary notions of

sex and gender.

The elf god Corellon Larethian is often

seen as and rogynous or hermaphroditic, for example,

and som e elves in the multiverse are made in Corellon’s

image.

You could also play a female character who

presents herself as a man, a man w ho feels trapped in a

female body, or a bearded female dwarf who hates being

mistaken for a male.

Likewise, you r character’s sexual

orientation is for you to decide.

### Heightand Weight

You can decide you r character’s height and weight,

using the information provided in you r race description

or on the Random Height and Weight table.

Think about

what you r character’s ability scores might say about his

or her height and weight.

A weak but agile character

might be thin.

A strong and tough character might be

tall or just heavy.

If you want to, you can roll randomly for you r

character’s height and weight using the Random Height

and W eight table.

The dice roll given in the Height

Modifier colum n determines the character’s extra

height (in inches) beyond the base height.

That same

num ber multiplied by the dice roll or quantity given in

the Weight Modifier colum n determines the character’s

extra weight (in pounds) beyond the base weight.

For example, as a human, Tika has a height of 4 feet 8

inches plus 2d10 inches.

Her player rolls 2 d 10 and gets

a total of 12, so Tika stands 5 feet 8 inches tall.

Then

the player uses that sam e roll of 12 and multiplies it by

2d4 pounds.

Her 2d4 roll is 3, so Tika weighs an extra

36 pounds ( 1 2 x 3) on top of her base 110 pounds, for a

total of 146 pounds.

### Other Physical Characteristics

You choose you r character’s age and the color of

his or her hair, eyes, and skin.

To add a touch of

distinctiveness, you might want to give you r character

an unusual or memorable physical characteristic, such

as a scar, a limp, or a tattoo.

Tik aan dAr tem i s : Cha rac ter Det ail s

Consider how the names Tika Waylan and Artemis Entreri

set the se characters apart from each other and reflect the ir

personalities.

Tika is a you ng woman determined to prove

that she's not just a kid any more, and her name makes her

sound you ng and ordinary.

Artemis Entreri comes from an

exotic land and carries a more mysterious name.

Tika is nineteen years old at the start of her adventuring

career and has auburn hair, green eyes, fair skin with freckles,

and a mole on her right hip.

Artemis is a small man, compact

and all wiry muscle.

He has angular features and high

cheekbones, and he always seems in need of a shave.

His

raven-black hair is thick and full, but his eyes are gray and

lifeless— betraying the emptiness of his life and soul.

### Alignment

A typical creature in the worlds of Dun geo n s &

Dra gon s has an alignment, which broadly describes

its moral and personal attitudes.

Alignment is a

combination of two factors: one identifies morality

(good, evil, or neutral), and the other describes

attitudes toward society and order (lawful, chaotic,

or neutral).

Thus, nine distinct alignments define the

possible combinations.

These brief sum m aries of the nine alignments

describe the typical behavior of a creature with that

alignment.

Individuals might vary significantly from

that typical behavior, and few people are perfectly and

consistently faithful to the precepts of the ir alignment.

Lawful good (LG) creatures can be counted on to do

the right thing as expected by society.

Gold dragons,

paladins, and m ost dwarves are lawful good.

Neutral good (NG) folk do the best the y can to help

others according to the ir needs.

Many celestials, som e

cloud giants, and most gnom es are neutral good.

Chaotic good (CG) creatures act as the ir conscience

directs, with little regard for what others expect.

Copper

dragons, many elves, and unicorns are chaotic good.

Lawful neutral (LN) individuals act in accordance

with law, tradition, or personal codes.

Many m onks and

som ewizards are lawful neutral.

Neutral (N) is the alignment of those w ho prefer to

steer clear of moral questions and don’t take sides,

druids, and many humans are neutral.

Chaotic neutral (CN) creatures follow the ir whims,

holding the ir personal freedom above all else.

Many barbarians and rogues, and som e bards, are

chaotic neutral.

Lawful evil (LE) creatures methodically take what the y

want, with in the limits of a code of tradition, loyalty, or

order.

Devils, blue dragons, and hobgoblins are lawful evil.

Neutral evil (NE) is the alignment of those who do

what ever the y can get away with, with out com passion or

qualms.

Many drow, som e cloud giants, and yugoloths

are neutral evil.

Chaotic evil (CE) creatures act with arbitrary

violence, spurred by the ir greed, hatred, or bloodlust.

Demons, red dragons, and orc s are chaotic evil.

### Alignmentinthe Multiverse

For many thinking creatures, alignment is a moral

choice.

Humans, dwarves, elves, and other humanoid

races can choose whether to follow the paths of good or

evil, law or chaos.

According to myth, the good-aligned

gods w ho created the se races gave the m free will to

choose the ir moral paths, knowing that good with out

free will is slavery.

The evil deities w ho created other races, though, made

those races to serve the m.

Those races have strong

inborn tendencies that match the nature of the ir gods.

Most orcs share the violent, savage nature of the orc

god, Gruumsh, and are thus inclined toward evil.

Even if

an orc chooses a good alignment, it struggles against its

innate tendencies for its entire life. (Even half-orcs feel

the lingering pull of the orc god’s influence.)

Alignment is an essential part of the nature of

celestials and fiends.

A devil does not choose to be

lawful evil, and it doesn’t tend toward lawful evil, but

rather it is lawful evil in its essence.

If it som ehow

ceased to be lawful evil, it w ould cease to be a devil.

Most creatures that lack the capacity for rational

thought do not have alignments—the y are unaligned.

Such a creature is incapable of making a moral or

ethical choice and acts according to its bestial nature.

Sharks are savage predators, for example, but the y are

not evil; the y have no alignment.

### Languages

Your race indicates the languages you r character can

speak by default, and you r background might give you

access to one or m ore additional languages ofyour

choice.

Note the se languages on you r character sheet.

C hoose you r languages from the Standard Languages

table, or choose one that is com m on in you r campaign.

With you r DM ’s perm ission, you can instead choose a

language from the Exotic Languages table or a secret

language, such as thieves’ cant or the tongue of druids.

Som e of the se languages are actually families

of languages with many dialects.

For example, the

Primordial language includes the Auran, Aquan, Ignan,

and Terran dialects, one for each of the four elemental

planes.

Creatures that speak different dialects ofthe

sam e language can com m unicate with one another.

Tika Waylan is neutral good, fundamentally good-hearted

and striving to help others where she can.

Artemis is lawful

evil, unconcerned with the value of sentient life but at least

professional in his approach to murder.

As an evil character, Artemis is not an ideal adventurer.

He

began his career as a villain, and only cooperates with heroes

when he must— and when it’s in his own best interests.

In

most games, evil adventurers cause problems in groups

alongside others who don’t share the ir interests and objectives.

Generally, evil alignments are for villains and monsters.

### Personal Characteristics

Fleshing out you r character’s personality—the array of

traits, mannerisms, habits, beliefs, and flaws that give

a person a unique identity—will help you bring him

or her to life as you play the game.

Four categories of

characteristics are presented here: personality traits,

ideals, bonds, and flaws.

Beyond those categories,

think about you r character’s favorite w ords or phrases,

tics and habitual gestures, vices and pet peeves, and

what ever else you can imagine.

Each background presented later in this chapter

includes suggested characteristics that you can use

to spark you r imagination.

You’re not bound to those

options, but the y’re a good starting point.

### Personality Traits

Give you r character two personality traits.

Personality

traits are small, simple ways to help you set you r

character apart from every other character.

Your

personality traits should tell you som ething interesting

and fun about you r character.

They should be self-

descriptions that are specific about what makes you r

character stand out. “I’m sm art” is not a good trait,

because it describes a lot of characters. “I’ve read every

book in Candlekeep” tells you som ething specific about

you r character’s interests and disposition.

Personality traits might describe the things you r

character likes, his or her past accomplishments, things

you r character dislikes or fears, you r character’s self-

attitude or mannerisms, or the influence ofhis or her

ability scores.

Elv ish Scr ipt : Sam ple Alp hab e t

Tik aan dAr tem i s : Per son alC har act eri sti c s

Tika and Artemis have distinct personality traits.

Tika Waylan

dislikes boastfulness and has a fear of heights resulting

from a bad fall during her career as a thief.

Artemis Entreri

is always prepared for the worst and moves with a quick,

precise confidence.

Consider the ir ideals.

Tika Waylan is innocent, almost

childlike, believing in the value of life and the importance of

appreciating everyone.

Neutral good in alignment, she cleaves

to ideals of life and respect.

Artemis Entreri never allows

his emotions to master him, and he constantly challenges

himself to improve his skills.

His lawful evil alignment gives

him ideals of impartiality and a lust for power.

Tika Waylan’s bond is to the Inn of the Last Home.

The

inn’s proprietor gave her a new chance at life, and her

friendship with her adventuring companions was forged

during her time working the re.

Its destruction by the

marauding dragonarmies gives Tika a very personal reason to

hate the m with a fiery passion.

Her bond might be phrased

as “ I will do what ever it takes to punish the dragonarmies for

the destruction of the Inn of the Last Home.”

Artemis Entreri’s bond is a strange, almost paradoxical

relationship with Drizzt Do’Urden, his equal in swordplay

and grim determination.

In his first battle with Drizzt,

Artemis recognized something of himself in his opponent,

some indication that if his life had gone differently, he

might have led a life more like the heroic drow’s.

From that

moment, Artemis is more than a criminal assassin— he is an

antihero, driven by his rivalry with Drizzt.

His bond might be

phrased as “ I will not rest until I have proved myself better

than Drizzt Do’Urden.”

Each of the se characters also has an important flaw.

Tika Waylan is naive and emotionally vulnerable, you nger

than her companions and annoyed that the y still think

of her as the kid the y knew years ago.

She might even be

tempted to act against her principles if she's convinced that

a particular achievement would demonstrate her maturity.

Artemis Entreri is completely walled off from any personal

relationship and just wants to be left alone.

A useful place to start thinking about personality

traits is to look at you r highest and lowest ability scores

and define one trait related to each.

Either one could be

positive or negative: you might work hard to overcome a

low score, for example, or be cocky about you r high score.

Dra con icS cri p t : Sam ple Alp hab e t

### Ideals

Describe one ideal that drives you r character.

Your ideals

are the things that you believe in m ost strongly, the

fundamental moral and ethical principles that com pel you

to act as you do.

Ideals encom pass everything from you r

life goals to you r core belief system.

Ideals might answer any of the se questions: What are

the principles that you will never betray?

What would

prompt you to make sacrifices?

What drives you to act

and guides you r goals and ambitions?

W hat is the single

most important thing you strive for?

You can choose any ideals you like, but you r

character’s alignment is a good place to start defining

the m.

Each background in this chapter includes six

suggested ideals.

Five of the m are linked to aspects of

alignment: law, chaos, good, evil, and neutrality.

The last

one has m ore to do with the particular background than

with moral or ethical perspectives.

### Bonds

Create one bond for you r character.

Bonds represent a

character’s connections to people, places, and events in

the world.

They tie you to things from you r background.

They might inspire you to heights of heroism, or lead

you to act against you r own best interests if the y are

threatened.

They can w ork very much like ideals,

driving a character’s motivations and goals.

Bonds might answer any of the se questions: W hom do

you care m ost about?

To what place do you feel a special

connection?

What is you r most treasured possession?

Your bonds might be tied to you r class, you r

background, you r race, or som e other aspect of you r

character’s history or personality.

You might also gain

new bonds over the course of you r adventures.

### Flaws

Finally, choose a flaw for you r character.

Your

character’s flaw represents som e vice, compulsion, fear,

or w eakness—in particular, anything that som eone

else could exploit to bring you to ruin or cause you to

act against you r best interests.

More significant than

negative personality traits, a flaw might answer any

of the se questions: What enrages you?

W hat’s the one

person, concept, or event that you are terrified of?

What

are you r vices?

In spir atio n

Inspiration is a rule the Dungeon Master can use to

reward you for playing you r character in a way that’s

true to his or her personality traits, ideal, bond, and flaw.

By using inspiration, you can draw on you r personality

trait of com passion for the downtrodden to give you

an edge in negotiating with the Beggar Prince.

Or

inspiration can let you call on you r bond to the defense

of you r home village to push past the effect of a spell

that has been laid on you.

### Gaining Inspiration

Your DM can choose to give you inspiration for a variety

of reasons.

Typically, DMs award it when you play

out you r personality traits, give in to the drawbacks

presented by a flaw or bond, and otherwise portray you r

character in a com pelling way.

Your DM will tell you

how you can earn inspiration in the game.

You either have inspiration or you don’t—you can’t

stockpile multiple “inspirations” for later use.

### Using Inspiration

If you have inspiration, you can expend it when you make

an attack roll, saving throw, or ability check.

Spending

you r inspiration gives you advantage on that roll.

Additionally, if you have inspiration, you can reward

another player for good roleplaying, clever thinking,

or simply doing som ething exciting in the game.

W hen another player character does som ething that

really contributes to the story in a fun and interesting

way, you can give up you r inspiration to give that

character inspiration.

Ba ckg rou nds

Every story has a beginning.

Your character’s

background reveals w here you cam e from, how you

becam e an adventurer, and you r place in the world.

Your fighter might have been a courageous knight or a

grizzled soldier.

Your wizard could have been a sage or

an artisan.

Your rogue might have gotten by as a guild

thief or com m and ed audiences as a jester.

Choosing a background provides you with important

story cues about you r character’s identity.

The most

important question to ask about you r background is

what changed?

W hy did you stop doing what ever you r

background describes and start adventuring?

W here

did you get the m oney to purchase you r starting gear, or,

if you com e from a wealthy background, why don't you

have more money?

H ow did you learn the skills of you r

class?

W hat sets you apart from ordinary people who

share you r background?

Tik aan dAr tem i s : Ba ckg rou nds

Tika Waylan and Artemis Entreri both lived the ir earliest years

as street urchins.

Tika’s later career as a barmaid didn’t really

change her, so she might choose the urchin background,

gaining proficiency in the Sleight of Hand and Stealth skills,

and learning the tools of the thieving trade.

Artemis is more

defined by his criminal background, giving him skills in

Deception and Stealth, as well as proficiency with the tools of

thievery and poison.

The sample backgrounds in this chapter provide

both concrete benefits (features, proficiencies, and

languages) and roleplaying suggestions.

### Proficiencies

Each background gives a character proficiency in two

skills.

Skills are described in chapter 7.

In addition, most backgrounds give a character

proficiency with one or m ore tools.

Tools and tool

proficiencies are detailed in chapter 5.

If a character would gain the same proficiency from

two different sources, he or she can choose a different

proficiency of the same kind (skill or tool) instead.

### Languages

Som e backgrounds also allow characters to learn

additional languages beyond those given by race.

See “Languages” earlier in this chapter.

## Equipment

### Suggested Characteristics

Each background provides a package of starting

equipment.

If you use the optional rule from chapter 5

to spend coin on gear, you do not receive the starting

equipment from you r background.

A background contains suggested personal

characteristics based on you r background.

You can

pick characteristics, roll dice to determine

the m randomly, or use the suggestions

as inspiration for characteristics of

you r own creation.

### Background

You might want to tweak

som e of the features of a

background so it better

fits you r character

or the campaign

setting.

To custom ize

a background, you can

replace one feature

with any other one,

choose any two

skills, and choose

a total of two tool

proficiencies or

languages from the

sample backgrounds.

You can either use

the equipment

package from you r

background or spend

coin on gear as

described in chapter

5. (If you spend

coin, you can’t also

take the equipment

package suggested

for you r class.)

Finally, choose

two personality

traits, one ideal, one bond, and one flaw.

If you can’t find

a feature that matches you r desired background, work

with you r DM to create one.

### Acolyte

You have spent you r life in the service of a temple

to a specific god or pantheon of gods.

You act as an

intermediary between the realm of the holy and the

mortal world, perform ing sacred rites and offering

sacrifices in order to conduct worshipers into the

presence of the divine.

You are not necessarily a

cleric-perform in g sacred rites is not the sam e thing as

channeling divine power.

Choose a god, a pantheon of gods, or som e other

quasi-divine being from am ong those listed in appendix

B or those specified by you r DM, and work with you r

DM to detail the nature of you r religious service.

W ere you a lesser functionary in a temple, raised from

childhood to assist the priests in the sacred rites?

Or

were you a high priest who suddenly experienced a call

to serve you r god in a different way?

Perhaps you were

the leader of a small cult outside of any established

temple structure, or even an occult group that served a

fiendish master that you now deny.

Skill Proficiencies: Insight, Religion

Languages: Two ofyour choice

Equipment: A holy sym bol (a gift to you when you

entered the priesthood), a prayer book or prayer

wheel, 5 sticks of incense, vestments, a set of com m on

clothes, and a belt pouch containing 15 gp

Fea tur e : She lte rof the Fa ith ful

As an acolyte, you com m and the respect of those who

share you r faith, and you can perform the religious

cerem onies of you r deity.

You and you r adventuring

com panions can expect to receive free healing and

care at a temple, shrine, or other established presence

of you r faith, though you must provide any material

com ponents needed for spells.

Those w ho share

you r religion will support you (but only you) at a

m odest lifestyle.

You might also have ties to a specific temple dedicated

to you r chosen deity or pantheon, and you have a

residence the re.

This could be the temple where you

used to serve, if you remain on good terms with it, or a

temple where you have found a new home.

W hile near

you r temple, you can call upon the priests for assistance,

provided the assistance you ask for is not hazardous and

you remain in good standing with you r temple.

### Suggested Characteristics

Acolytes are shaped by the ir experience in temples

or other religious communities.

Their study of the

history and tenets of the ir faith and the ir relationships

to temples, shrines, or hierarchies affect the ir

m annerism s and ideals.

Their flaws might be som e

hidden hypocrisy or heretical idea, or an ideal or bond

taken to an extreme.

As amem ber of you r guild, you know the skills needed

to create finished items from raw materials (reflected in

Fea tur e : Gui ldM emb ers hip

As an established and respected m em ber of a guild, you

can rely on certain benefits that m em bership provides.

Your fellow guild m em bers will provide you with

lodging and food if necessary, and pay for you r funeral

if needed.

In som e cities and towns, a guildhall offers a

central place to meet other m em bers of you r profession,

which can be a good place to meet potential patrons,

allies, or hirelings.

Guilds often wield tremendous political power.

If

you are accused of a crime, you r guild will support you

if a good case can be made for you r innocence or the

crim e is justifiable.

You can also gain access to powerful

political figures through the guild, if you are a member

in good standing.

Such connections might require the

donation of money or m agic items to the guild’s coffers.

You must pay dues of 5 gp per month to the guild.

Var ian tGu ild Art isa n : Guild Mer cha n t

Instead of an artisans’ guild, you might belong to a

guild of traders, caravan masters, or shopkeepers.

You

don’t craft items you rself but earn a living by buying

and selling the works of others (or the raw materials

artisans need to practice the ir craft).

Your guild might

be a large merchant consortium (or family) with

interests across the region.

Perhaps you transported

goods from one place to another, by ship, wagon, or

caravan, or bought the m from traveling traders and sold

the m in you r own little shop.

In som e ways, the traveling

merchant’s life lends itself to adventure far m ore than

the life of an artisan.

Rather than proficiency with artisan’s tools, you might

be proficient with navigator’s tools or an additional

language.

And instead of artisan’s tools, you can start

with a mule and a cart.

seclusion, or you can choose or roll on the table below to

determine the reason behind you r seclusion.

Fea tur e : Dis cov ery

The quiet seclusion of you r extended hermitage gave you

The exact

nature of this revelation depends on the nature of you r

seclusion.

It might be a great truth about the cosm os,

the deities, the powerful beings of the outer planes, or

the forces of nature.

It could be a site that no one else

has ever seen.

You might have uncovered a fact that has

long been forgotten, or unearthed som e relic of the past

that could rewrite history.

It might be information that

would be damaging to the people w ho or consigned you

to exile, and hence the reason for you r return to society.

W ork with you r DM to determine the details of you r

discovery and its impact on the campaign.

### Suggested Characteristics

Som e hermits are well suited to a life of seclusion,

whereas others chafe against it and long for company.

This hermit background assum es a contemplative sort

of seclusion that allows room for study and prayer.

If you

want to play a rugged wilderness recluse who lives off

the land while shunning the company of other people,

look at the outlander background.

On the other hand, if

might be what you’re looking for.

Or you could even be a

charlatan, posing as awise and holy person and letting

pious fools support you.

### Noble

You understand wealth, power, and privilege.

You

carry a noble title, and you r family owns land, collects

taxes, and w ields significant political influence.

You

might be a pam pered aristocrat unfamiliar with

work or discom fort, a form er merchant just elevated

to the nobility, or a disinherited scoundrel with a

disproportionate sense of entitlement.

aware of you r responsibility to the m.

title and determine how much authority that title

carries.

A noble title doesn’t stand on its ow n—it’s

connected to an entire family, and what ever title you

hold, you will pass it down to you r own children.

Not

only do you need to determine you r noble title, but you

should also work with the DM to describe you r family

and the ir influence on you.

Is you r family old and established, or w as you r title

only recently bestowed?

H ow much influence do the y

What kind of reputation

does you r family have am ong the other aristocrats of the

region?

H ow do the com m on people regard the m?

W hat’s you r position in the family?

Are you the heir

to the head of the family?

Have you already inherited

the title?

H ow do you feel about that responsibility?

Or

are you so far down the line of inheritance that no one

cares what you do, as long as you don’t embarrass the

family?

H ow does the head of you r family feel about

you r adventuring career?

Are you in you r family’s good

graces, or shunned by the rest of you r family?

D oes you r family have a coat ofarms?

An insignia you

Fea tur e : Res ear che r

W hen you attempt to learn or recall a piece of lore, if you

do not know that information, you often know where and

Usually, this information

com es from a library, scriptorium, university, or a sage

or other learned person or creature.

Your DM might

rule that the knowledge you seek is secreted away in an

almost inaccessible place, or that it simply cannot be

found.

Unearthing the deepest secrets of the multiverse

can require an adventure or even a whole campaign.

### Suggested Characteristics

### Sailor

You sailed on a seagoing vessel for years.

In that

time, you faced down mighty storms, m onsters ofthe

deep, and those who wanted to sink you r craft to the

bottom less depths.

Your first love is the distant line of

the horizon, but the time has com e to try you r hand

at som ething new.

Discuss the nature of the ship you previously sailed

with you r Dungeon Master.

W as it a merchant ship,

a naval vessel, a ship of discovery, or a pirate ship?

H ow fam ous (or infamous) is it?

Is it widely traveled?

Is it still sailing, or is it m issing and presum ed lost

with all hands?

What w ere you r duties on board—boatswain, captain,

navigator, cook, or som e other position?

W ho were the

captain and first mate?

Did you leave you r ship on good

terms with you r fellows, or on the run?

Skill Proficiencies: Athletics, Perception

Tool Proficiencies: Navigator’s tools, vehicles (water)

Equipment: A belaying pin (club), 50 feet of silk rope,

a lucky charm such as a rabbit foot or a small stone

Fea tur e : Shi p ’s Pa ssa g e

W hen you need to, you can secure free passage on

a sailing ship for you rself and you r adventuring

com panions.

You might sail on the ship you served on,

or another ship you have good relations with (perhaps

one captained by a former crewmate).

Because you’re

calling in a favor, you can’t be certain of a schedule or

route that will meet you r every need.

Your Dungeon

Master will determine how long it takes to get where

you need to go.

In return for you r free passage, you

and you r com panions are expected to assist the crew

during the voyage.

### Suggested Characteristics

on the high seas and sent m ore than one deserving soul

instead of the Ship’s Passage feature.

No matter where you go, people are afraid of you due to

to pay for food at a tavern or breaking down doors at a local

shop, since most people will not report you r activity to the

Members of the nobility trade either in legal rights, such

as the rights to a mine, a port, or farmland, or in gold

bars, measuring gold by the pound rather than by the

coin.

Only merchants, adventurers, and those offering

professional services for hire com m only deal in coins.

### Coinage

Com m on coins com e in several different denominations

based on the relative worth of the metal from which the y

are made.

The three most com m on coins are the gold

piece (gp), the silver piece (sp), and the copper piece (cp).

With one gold piece, a character can buy a belt

pouch, 50 feet of good rope, or a goat.

A skilled (but

not exceptional) artisan can earn one gold piece a day.

The gold piece is the standard unit of measure for

wealth, even if the coin itself is not com m only used.

W hen merchants discuss deals that involve goods or

services worth hundreds or thousands of gold pieces,

the transactions don’t usually involve the exchange of

individual coins.

Rather, the gold piece is a standard

m easure of value, and the actual exchange is in gold

bars, letters of credit, or valuable goods.

One gold piece is w orth ten silver pieces, the most

prevalent coin among com m oners.

A silver piece buys a

laborer’swork for a day, a flask of lamp oil, or a night’s

rest in a poor inn.

One silver piece is worth ten copper pieces, which are

com m on am ong laborers and beggars.

A single copper

piece buys a candle, a torch, or a piece of chalk.

In addition, unusual coins made of other precious

metals som etim es appear in treasure hoards.

The

electrum piece (ep) and the platinum piece (pp) originate

from fallen empires and lost kingdom s, and the y

som etim es arouse suspicion and skepticism when used

in transactions.

An electrum piece is worth five silver

pieces, and a platinum piece is worth ten gold pieces.

A standard coin weighs about a third of an ounce,

so fifty coins weigh a pound.

E MARKETPLACE OF A LARGE CITY TEEMS

with buyers and sellers of many sorts:

dwarf smiths and elf woodcarvers, halfling

farmers and gnome jewelers, not to mention

humans of every shape, size, and color

drawn from a spectrum of nations and

cultures.

In the largest cities, almost

anything imaginable is offered for sale, from exotic

spices and luxurious clothing to wicker baskets and

practical swords.

For an adventurer, the availability of armor, weapons,

backpacks, rope, and similar goods is of paramount

im portance, since proper equipment can mean the

difference between life and death in a dungeon or the

untamed wilds.

This chapter details the mundane and

exotic merchandise that adventurers commonly find useful

in the face of the threats that the worlds of D&D present.

St art in gEq u ip men t

W hen you create you r character, you receive equipment

based on a combination of you r class and background.

Alternatively, you can start with a num ber of gold pieces

based on you r class and spend the m on items from the

lists in this chapter.

See the Starting Wealth by Class

table to determine how much gold you have to spend.

You decide how you r character cam e by this starting

equipment.

It might have been an inheritance, or goods

that the character purchased during his or her upbringing.

You might have been equipped with a weapon, armor, and

a backpack as part of military service.

You might even have

stolen you r gear.

Aweapon could be a family heirloom,

passed down from generation to generation until you r

character finally took up the mantle and followed in an

ancestor’s adventurous footsteps.

Wealth appears in many forms in a D&D world.

Coins,

gemstones, trade goods, art objects, animals, and

property can reflect you r character’s financial well-being.

Members of the peasantry trade in goods, bartering for

what the y need and paying taxes in grain and cheese.

### Selling Treasure

Opportunities abound to find treasure, equipment,

weapons, armor, and m ore in the dungeons you explore.

Normally, you can sell you r treasures and trinkets when

you return to a town or other settlement, provided that you

can find buyers and merchants interested in you r loot.

Arms, Armor, and Other Equipment.

As a general

rule, undamaged weapons, armor, and other equipment

fetch half the ir cost when sold in a market.

W eapons

and armor used by m onsters are rarely in good enough

condition to sell.

Magic Items.

Selling m agic items is problematic.

Finding som eone to buy a potion or a scroll isn’t too

hard, but other items are out of the realm of most but the

wealthiest nobles.

Likewise, aside from a few com m on

magic items, you w on’t normally com e across magic

items or spells to purchase.

The value of magic is far

beyond simple gold and should always be treated as such.

Gems, Jewelry, and Art Objects.

These items retain

the ir full value in the marketplace, and you can either

trade the m in for coin or use the m as currency for other

transactions.

For exceptionally valuable treasures, the

DM might require you to find a buyer in a large town or

larger community first.

Trade Goods.

On the borderlands, many people

conduct transactions through barter.

Like gems and art

objects, trade goods—bars of iron, bags of salt, livestock,

and so on—retain the ir full value in the market and can

be used as currency.

Arm ora ndSh ie lds

D&D worlds are a vast tapestry made up of many

different cultures, each with its own technology level.

For this reason, adventurers have access to a variety

of armor types, ranging from leather armor to chain

mail to costly plate armor, with several other kinds of

armor in between.

The Arm or table collects the most

com m only available types of armor found in the game

and separates the m into three categories: light armor,

medium armor, and heavy armor.

Many warriors

supplement the ir armor with a shield.

Var ian t : Equ ipm ent Siz e s

In most campaigns, you can use or wear any equipment that

you find on you r adventures, with in the bounds of common

sense.

For example, a burly half-orc won't fit in a halfling’s

leather armor, and a gnome would be swallowed up in a

cloud giant’s elegant robe.

The DM can impose more realism.

For example, a suit of

plate armor made for one human might not fit another one

with out significant alterations, and a guard’s uniform might

be visibly ill-fitting when an adventurer tries to wear it as a

disguise.

Using this variant, when adventurers find armor, clothing,

and similar items that are made to be worn, the y might need

to visit an armorsmith, tailor, leatherworker, or similar expert

to make the item wearable.

The cost for such work varies

from 10 to 40 percent of the market price of the item.

The

DM can either roll 1d4 x 10 or determine the increase in cost

based on the extent of the alterations required.

The Arm or table shows the cost, weight, and other

properties of the com m on types of armor worn in the

worlds of D&D.

Armor Proficiency.

Anyone can put on a suit ofarmor

or strap a shield to an arm.

Only those proficient in the

arm or’s use know how to w ear it effectively, however.

Your class gives you proficiency with certain types of

armor.

If you w ear armor that you lack proficiency with,

you have disadvantage on any ability check, saving

throw, or attack roll that involves Strength or Dexterity,

and you can’t cast spells.

Armor Class (AC).

Arm or protects its w earer from

attacks.

The armor (and shield) you w ear determines

you r base Arm or Class.

Heavy Armor.

Heavier armor interferes with the

w earer’s ability to move quickly, stealthily, and freely.

If the Arm or table shows “Str 13” or “Str 15” in the

Strength colum n for an armor type, the armor reduces

the w earer’s speed by 10 feet unless the w earer has a

Strength score equal to or higher than the listed score.

Stealth.

If the Arm or table shows “Disadvantage” in

the Stealth column, the wearer has disadvantage on

Dexterity (Stealth) checks.

Shields.

A shield is made from w ood or metal and

is carried in one hand.

W ielding a shield increases

you r Arm or Class by 2.

You can benefit from only one

shield at a time.

### Light Armor

Made from supple and thin materials, light arm or favors

agile adventurers since it offers som e protection with out

sacrificing mobility.

If you w ear light armor, you add

you r Dexterity m odifier to the base number from you r

armor type to determine you r Arm or Class.

Padded.

Padded armor consists of quilted layers of

cloth and batting.

Leather.

The breastplate and shoulder protectors of

this arm or are made of leather that has been stiffened

by being boiled in oil.

The rest of the armor is made of

softer and m ore flexible materials.

Studded Leather.

Made from tough but flexible

leather, studded leather is reinforced with close-set

rivets or spikes.

### Medium Armor

Medium armor offers m ore protection than light armor,

but it also impairs movement more.

If you wear medium

armor, you add you r Dexterity modifier, to a maximum

of +2, to the base number from you r armor type to

determine you r Arm or Class.

Hide.

This crude arm or consists ofthick furs and

pelts.

It is com m only worn by barbarian tribes, evil

humanoids, and other folk who lack access to the tools

and materials needed to create better armor.

Chain Shirt.

Made of interlocking metal rings, a chain

shirt is worn between layers ofclothing or leather.

This

armor offers m odest protection to the wearer’s upper

body and allows the sound of the rings rubbing against

one another to be muffled by outer layers.

Scale Mail.

This armor consists of a coat and leggings

(and perhaps a separate skirt) ofleather covered with

overlapping pieces of metal, much like the scales of a

fish.

The suit includes gauntlets.

Breastplate.

This armor consists of a fitted metal

chest piece worn with supple leather.

Although it leaves

the legs and arms relatively unprotected, this armor

provides good protection for the w earer’s vital organs

while leaving the w earer relatively unencumbered.

H alf Plate.

Half plate consists of shaped metal plates

that cover m ost of the wearer’s body.

It does not include

leg protection beyond simple greaves that are attached

with leather straps.

### Heavy Armor

Of all the armor categories, heavy armor offers the best

protection.

These suits ofarmor cover the entire body

and are designed to stop a wide range of attacks.

Only

proficient w arriors can manage the ir weight and bulk.

Heavy armor doesn’t let you add you r Dexterity

modifier to you r Arm or Class, but it also doesn’t

penalize you if you r Dexterity m odifier is negative.

Ring Mail.

This armor is leather armor with heavy

rings sewn into it.

The rings help reinforce the armor

against blows from swords and axes.

Ring mail is

inferior to chain mail, and it's usually worn only by those

w ho can’t afford better armor.

Chain Mail.

Made of interlocking metal rings, chain

mail includes a layer of quilted fabric worn underneath

the mail to prevent chafing and to cushion the impact of

blows.

The suit includes gauntlets.

Splint.

This armor is made of narrow vertical strips

of metal riveted to a backing of leather that is worn over

cloth padding.

Flexible chain mail protects the joints.

Plate.

Plate consists ofshaped, interlocking metal

plates to cover the entire body.

A suit of plate includes

gauntlets, heavy leather boots, a visored helmet, and

thick layers of padding underneath the armor.

Buckles

and straps distribute the weight over the body.

### Getting Intoand Outof Armor

The time it takes to don or doff armor depends on the

arm or’s category.

Don.

This is the time it takes to put on armor.

You

benefit from the armor's AC only if you take the full time

to don the suit of armor.

Doff.

This is the time it takes to take off armor.

If you

have help, reduce this time by half.

### Weapon Proficiency

Your race, class, and feats can grant you proficiency

with certain weapons or categories of weapons.

The two

categories are simple and martial.

Most people can

use simple w eapons with proficiency.

These weapons

include clubs, m aces, and other w eapons often found in

the hands of com m oners.

Martial w eapons, including

swords, axes, and polearm s, require m ore specialized

training to use effectively.

M ost warriors use martial

w eapons because the se w eapons put the ir fighting style

and training to best use.

Proficiency with aweapon allows you to add you r

proficiency bonus to the attack roll for any attack you

make with that weapon.

If you make an attack roll using

aweapon with w hich you lack proficiency, you do not

add you r proficiency bonus to the attack roll.

### Weapon Properties

Many weapons have special properties related to the ir use,

as shown in the W eapons table.

Ammunition.

You can use a weapon that has the

ammunition property to make a ranged attack only if

you have ammunition to fire from the weapon.

Each

time you attack with the weapon, you expend one piece

of ammunition.

Drawing the ammunition from a quiver,

case, or other container is part of the attack.

At the

end of the battle, you can recover half you r expended

ammunition by taking a minute to search the battlefield.

Your class grants proficiency in certain weapons,

reflecting both the class's focus and the tools you are

most likely to use.

W hether you favor a longsword or

a longbow, you r w eapon and you r ability to wield it

effectively can m ean the difference between life and

death while adventuring.

The W eapons table shows the most com m on weapons

used in the worlds of D&D, the ir price and weight,

the damage the y deal when the y hit, and any special

properties the y possess.

Every weapon is classified

as either melee or ranged.

A melee weapon is used to

attack a target with in 5 feet of you, whereas a ranged

weapon is used to attack a target at a distance.

If you use a weapon that has the ammunition property

to make a melee attack, you treat the weapon as an

improvised weapon (see "Improvised Weapons" later in

the section).

A sling must be loaded to deal any damage

when used in this way.

Finesse.

When making an attack with a finesse

weapon, you use you r choice ofyour Strength or

Dexterity modifier for the attack and damage rolls.

You

must use the same m odifier for both rolls.

Heavy.

Sm all creatures have disadvantage on attack

rolls with heavy weapons.

A heavy w eapon’s size and

bulk make it too large for a Sm all creature to use

effectively.

Light.

A light weapon is small and easy to handle,

making it ideal for use when fighting with two weapons.

See the rules for two-weapon fighting in chapter 9.

Loading.

Because of the time required to load this

weapon, you can fire only one piece of ammunition

from it when you use an action, bonus action, or reaction

to fire it, regardless of the number of attacks you can

normally make.

Range.

A weapon that can be used to make a ranged

attack has a range shown in parentheses after the

ammunition or thrown property.

The range lists two

numbers.

The first is the w eapon’s normal range in feet,

and the second indicates the w eapon’s maximum range.

W hen attacking a target beyond normal range, you have

disadvantage on the attack roll.

You can’t attack a target

beyond the w eapon’s long range.

Reach.

This w eapon adds 5 feet to you r reach when

you attack with it.

Special.

Aweapon with the special property has

unusual rules governing its use, explained in the

w eapon’s description (see "Special W eapons" later in

this section).

Thrown.

If a weapon has the thrown property, you

can throw the w eapon to make a ranged attack.

If the

weapon is a melee weapon, you use the same ability

m odifier for that attack roll and damage roll that you

would use for a melee attack with the weapon.

For

example, if you throw a handaxe, you use you r Strength,

but if you throw a dagger, you can use either you r

Strength or you r Dexterity, since the dagger has the

finesse property.

Two-Handed.

This w eapon requires two hands to use.

Versatile.

This weapon can be used with one or two

hands.

A damage value in parentheses appears with the

property—the damage when the weapon is used with

two hands to make a melee attack.

### Improvised Weapons

Som etim es characters don’t have the ir w eapons and

have to attack with what ever is close at hand.

An

im provised weapon includes any object you can wield

in one or two hands, such as broken glass, a table leg, a

frying pan, awagon wheel, or a dead goblin.

In many cases, an im provised weapon is similar

to an actual weapon and can be treated as such.

For

example, a table leg is akin to a club.

At the DM ’s option,

a character proficient with a weapon can use a similar

object as if it w ere that weapon and use his or her

proficiency bonus.

An object that bears no resem blance to a weapon

deals 1d4 damage (the DM assigns a damage type

appropriate to the object).

If a character uses a ranged

weapon to make amelee attack, or throws a melee

weapon that does not have the thrown property, it also

deals 1d4 damage.

An improvised thrown weapon has a

normal range of 20 feet and a long range of 60 feet.

### Silvered Weapons

Som emonsters that have immunity or resistance

to nonm agical w eapons are susceptible to silver

weapons, so cautious adventurers invest extra coin to

plate the ir w eapons with silver.

You can silver a single

weapon or ten pieces of ammunition for 100 gp.

This

cost represents not only the price of the silver, but the

time and expertise needed to add silver to the weapon

with out making it less effective.

### Special Weapons

W eapons with special rules are described here.

Lance.

You have disadvantage when you use a lance

to attack a target with in 5 feet of you.

Also, a lance

requires two hands to wield when you aren’t mounted.

Net.

A Large or smaller creature hit by a net is

restrained until it is freed.

A net has no effect on

creatures that are formless, or creatures that are Huge

or larger.

A creature can use its action to make a DC 10

Strength check, freeing itself or another creature with in

its reach on a success.

Dealing 5 slashing damage to the

net (AC 10) also frees the creature with out harming it,

ending the effect and destroying the net.

W hen you use an action, bonus action, or reaction

to attack with a net, you can make only one attack

regardless of the number of attacks you can

normally make.

### Adventuring Gear

This section describes items that have special rules or

require further explanation.

Acid.

As an action, you can splash the contents of

this vial onto a creature with in 5 feet of you or throw

the vial up to 20 feet, shattering it on impact.

In either

case, make a ranged attack against a creature or object,

treating the acid as an im provised weapon.

On a hit, the

target takes 2d6 acid damage.

Alchemist’s Fire.

This sticky, adhesive fluid ignites

when exposed to air.

As an action, you can throw this

flask up to 20 feet, shattering it on impact.

Make a

ranged attack against a creature or object, treating

### Tools

A tool helps you to do som ething you couldn't otherwise

do, such as craft or repair an item, forge a document, or

pick a lock.

Your race, class, background, or feats give

you proficiency with certain tools.

Proficiency with a tool

allows you to add you r proficiency bonus to any ability

check you make using that tool.

Tool use is not tied to

a single ability, since proficiency with a tool represents

broader knowledge of its use.

For example, the DM

might ask you to make a Dexterity check to carve a fine

detail with you r w oodcarver’s tools, or a Strength check

to make som ething out of particularly hard w ood.

Mou nts and Veh ic les

A good mount can help you move m ore quickly through

the w ilderness, but its primary purpose is to carry the

gear that w ould otherwise slow you down.

The Mounts

and Other Anim als table shows each animal’s speed and

base carrying capacity.

An animal pulling a carriage, cart, chariot, sled,

or wagon can move weight up to five times its base

carrying capacity, including the weight of the vehicle.

If multiple animals pull the same vehicle, the y can add

the ir carrying capacity together.

Mounts other than those listed here are available in

the worlds of D&D, but the y are rare and not normally

available for purchase.

These include flying mounts

(pegasi, griffons, hippogriffs, and similar animals) and

even aquatic mounts (giant sea horses, for example).

Acquiring such a mount often means securing an egg

and raising the creature you rself, making a bargain with

a powerful entity, or negotiating with the mount itself.

Barding.

Barding is arm or designed to protect an

anim al’s head, neck, chest, and body.

Any type of

arm or shown on the Arm or table in this chapter can

be purchased as barding.

The cost is four times the

equivalent armor made for humanoids, and it weighs

tw ice as much.

Saddles.

A military saddle braces the rider, helping

you keep you r seat on an active mount in battle.

It

gives you advantage on any check you make to remain

mounted.

An exotic saddle is required for riding any

aquatic or flying mount.

Vehicle Proficiency.

If you have proficiency with a

certain kind of vehicle (land or water), you can add you r

proficiency bonus to any check you make to control that

kind of vehicle in difficult circum stances.

Rowed Vessels.

Keelboats and rowboats are used on

lakes and rivers.

If going downstream, add the speed of

the current (typically 3 m iles per hour) to the speed of

the vehicle.

These vehicles can’t be rowed against any

significant current, but the y can be pulled upstream

by draft animals on the shores.

A rowboat weighs 100

pounds, in case adventurers carry it over land.

(such as a mine or a forest).

Guilds, nobles, and royalty regulate trade.

Chartered

com panies are granted rights to conduct trade along

certain routes, to send merchant ships to various ports,

or to buy or sell specific goods.

Guilds set prices for

the goods or services that the y control, and determine

who may or may not offer those goods and services.

Merchants com m only exchange trade goods with out

using currency.

E xp ense s

W hen not descending into the depths of the earth,

exploring ruins for lost treasures, or waging war against

the encroaching darkness, adventurers face m ore

mundane realities.

Even in a fantastical world, people

require basic necessities such as shelter, sustenance,

and clothing.

These things cost money, although som e

lifestyles cost m ore than others.

### Lifestyle Expenses

Lifestyle expenses provide you with a simple way to

account for the cost of living in a fantasy world.

They

cover you r accom m odations, food and drink, and all

you r other necessities.

Furthermore, expenses cover the

cost of maintaining you r equipment so you can be ready

when adventure next calls.

At the start of each w eek or month (you r choice),

choose a lifestyle from the Expenses table and pay the

price to sustain that lifestyle.

The prices listed are per

day, so if you wish to calculate the cost of you r chosen

lifestyle over a thirty-day period, multiply the listed price

by 30.

Your lifestyle might change from one period to

the next, based on the funds you have at you r disposal,

or you might maintain the same lifestyle throughout

you r character’s career.

Your lifestyle choice can have consequences.

Maintaining a wealthy lifestyle might help you make

contacts with the rich and powerful, though you run the

risk of attracting thieves.

Likewise, living frugally might

help you avoid criminals, but you are unlikely to make

powerful connections.

Wretched.

You live in inhumane conditions.

With

no place to call home, you shelter wherever you can,

sneaking into barns, huddling in old crates, and relying

on the good graces of people better off than you.

A

wretched lifestyle presents abundant dangers.

Violence,

disease, and hunger follow you wherever you go.

Other

wretched people covet you r armor, weapons, and

adventuring gear, which represent a fortune by the ir

standards.

You are beneath the notice of most people.

Squalid.

You live in a leaky stable, a mud-floored hut

just outside town, or a vermin-infested boarding house

in the worst part of town.

You have shelter from the

elements, but you live in a desperate and often violent

environment, in places rife with disease, hunger, and

misfortune.

You are beneath the notice of m ost people,

and you have few legal protections.

Most people at

this lifestyle level have suffered som e terrible setback.

They might be disturbed, marked as exiles, or suffer

from disease.

Poor.

A poor lifestyle means going with out the

com forts available in a stable community.

Simple food

and lodgings, threadbare clothing, and unpredictable

conditions result in a sufficient, though probably

unpleasant, experience.

Your accom m odations might

be a room in a flophouse or in the com m on room above

a tavern.

You benefit from som e legal protections,

but you still have to contend with violence, crime,

and disease.

People at this lifestyle level tend to be

unskilled laborers, costerm ongers, peddlers, thieves,

mercenaries, and other disreputable types.

Modest.

Amodest lifestyle keeps you out of the slums

and ensures that you can maintain you r equipment.

You live in an older part of town, renting a room in a

boarding house, inn, or temple.

You don't go hungry or

thirsty, and you r living conditions are clean, if simple.

Ordinary people living m odest lifestyles include soldiers

with families, laborers, students, priests, hedge wizards,

and the like.

Comfortable.

Choosing a com fortable lifestyle

means that you can afford nicer clothing and can easily

maintain you r equipment.

You live in a small cottage

in a middle-class neighborhood or in a private room

at a fine inn.

You associate with merchants, skilled

tradespeople, and military officers.

Wealthy.

Choosing a wealthy lifestyle means living a

life of luxury, though you might not have achieved the

social status associated with the old money of nobility

or royalty.

You live a lifestyle com parable to that of a

highly successful merchant, a favored servant of the

royalty, or the owner of a few small businesses.

You

have respectable lodgings, usually a spacious hom e in

a good part of town or a com fortable suite at a fine inn.

You likely have a small staff of servants.

Aristocratic.

You live a life of plenty and comfort.

You

move in circles populated by the m ost powerful people

in the community.

You have excellent lodgings, perhaps

a townhouse in the nicest part of town or room s in the

finest inn.

You dine at the best restaurants, retain the

most skilled and fashionable tailor, and have servants

attending to you r every need.

You receive invitations

to the social gatherings of the rich and powerful, and

spend evenings in the company of politicians, guild

leaders, high priests, and nobility.

You must also

contend with the highest levels of deceit and treachery.

The wealthier you are, the greater the chance you will

be drawn into political intrigue as a pawn or participant.

Sel f - Suf fic ien c y

The expenses and lifestyles described in this chapter assume

that you are spending you r time between adventures in town,

availing you rself of what ever services you can afford— paying

for food and shelter, paying townspeople to sharpen you r

sword and repair you r armor, and so on.

Some characters,

though, might prefer to spend the ir time away from

civilization, sustaining the mselves in the wild by hunting,

foraging, and repairing the ir own gear.

Maintaining this kind of lifestyle doesn’t require you to

spend any coin, but it is time-consuming.

If you spend

you r time between adventures practicing a profession, as

described in chapter 8, you can eke out the equivalent of a

poor lifestyle.

Proficiency in the Survival skill lets you live at

the equivalent of a comfortable lifestyle.

### Services

Adventurers can pay nonplayer characters to assist the m

or act on the ir behalf in a variety ofcircum stances.

Most

such hirelings have fairly ordinary skills, while others

are masters of a craft or art, and a few are experts with

specialized adventuring skills.

S om e of the most basic types of hirelings appear on

the Services table.

Other com m on hirelings include

any of the wide variety of people who inhabit a typical

town or city, when the adventurers pay the m to

perform a specific task.

For example, a wizard might

pay a carpenter to construct an elaborate chest (and

its miniature replica) for use in the Leomund’s secret

chest spell.

A fighter might com m ission a blacksmith to

forge a special sword.

A bard might pay a tailor to make

exquisite clothing for an upcom ing perform ance in

front of the duke.

Other hirelings provide m ore expert or dangerous

services.

M ercenary soldiers paid to help the

adventurers take on a hobgoblin army are hirelings, as

are sages hired to research ancient or esoteric lore.

If a

high-level adventurer establishes a stronghold of som e

kind, he or she might hire a whole staff of servants and

agents to run the place, from a castellan or steward

to menial laborers to keep the stables clean.

These

hirelings often enjoy a long-term contract that includes

a place to live with in the stronghold as part of the

offered compensation.

Skilled hirelings include anyone hired to perform a

service that involves a proficiency (including weapon,

tool, or skill): a mercenary, artisan, scribe, and so on.

The pay shown is a minimum; som e expert hirelings

require m ore pay.

Untrained hirelings are hired for

menial work that requires no particular skill and can

include laborers, porters, maids, and similar workers.

### Spellcasting Services

People w ho are able to cast spells don’t fall into the

category of ordinary hirelings.

It might be possible to

find som eone w illing to cast a spell in exchange for coin

or favors, but it is rarely easy and no established pay

rates exist.

As a rule, the higher the level of the desired

spell, the harder it is to find som eone who can cast it

and the m ore it costs.

Hiring som eone to cast a relatively com m on spell

of 1st or 2nd level, such as cure wounds or identify, is

easy enough in a city or town, and might cost 10 to 50

gold pieces (plus the cost of any expensive material

components).

Finding som eone able and will ing to

cast a higher-level spell might involve traveling to a

large city, perhaps one with a university or prominent

temple.

Once found, the spellcaster might ask for a

service instead of payment—the kind of service that

only adventurers can provide, such as retrieving a rare

item from a dangerous locale or traversing a monster-

infested wilderness to deliver som ething important to

a distant settlement.

Trin ket s

W hen you make you r character, you can roll once on

the Trinkets table to gain a trinket, a simple item lightly

touched by mystery.

The DM might also use this table.

It can help stock a room in a dungeon or fill a creature’s

pockets.

## 6. Customization Options

### Multiclassing Example

THE COMBINATION OF ABILITY SCORES, RACE,

class, and background defines you r

character’s capabilities in the game, and

the personal details you create set you r

character apart from every other character.

Even with in you r class and race, you have

options to fine-tune what you r character

can do.

But this chapter is for players w ho—with the

DM ’s perm ission—want to go a step further.

This chapter defines two optional sets of rules for

customizing you r character: multiclassing and feats.

Multiclassing lets you com bine classes together,

and feats are special options you can choose instead

of increasing you r ability scores as you gain levels.

Your DM decides whether the se options are available

in a campaign.

Mul t ic las s in g

Multiclassing allows you to gain levels in multiple

classes.

Doing so lets you m ix the abilities of those

classes to realize a character concept that might not be

reflected in one of the standard class options.

With this rule, you have the option of gaining a level

in a new class when ever you advance in level, instead

of gaining a level in you r current class.

Your levels in

all you r classes are added together to determine you r

character level.

For example, if you have three levels in

wizard and two in fighter, you’re a 5th-level character.

As you advance in levels, you might primarily remain

amem ber of you r original class with just a few levels

in another class, or you might change course entirely,

never looking back at the class you left behind.

You

might even start progressing in a third or fourth class.

Com pared to a single-class character of the sam e level,

you’ll sacrifice som e focus in exchange for versatility.

Gary is playing a 4th-level fighter.

When his character earns

enough experience points to reach 5th level, Gary decides

that his character will multiclass instead of continuing to

progress as a fighter.

Gary’s fighter has been spending a lot

of time with Dave’s rogue, and has even been doing some

jobs on the side for the local thieves’ guild as a bruiser.

Gary

decides that his character will multiclass into the rogue class,

and thus his character becomes a 4th-level fighter and 1st-

level rogue (written as fighter 4/rogue 1).

When Gary’s character earns enough experience to

reach 6th level, he can decide whether to add another

fighter level (becoming a fighter 5/rogue 1), another rogue

level (becoming a fighter 4/rogue 2), or a level in a third

class, perhaps dabbling in wizardry thanks to the tome of

mysterious lore he acquired (becoming a fighter 4/rogue 1/

wizard 1).

### Prerequisites

To qualify for a new class, you must meet the ability score

prerequisites for both you r current class and you r new

one, as shown in the Multiclassing Prerequisites table.

For example, a barbarian w ho decides to multiclass into

the druid class must have both Strength and W isdom

scores of 13 or higher.

Without the full training that

a beginning character receives, you must be a quick

study in you r new class, having a natural aptitude that

is reflected by higher-than-average ability scores.

### Experience Points

The experience point cost to gain a level is always

based on you r total character level, as shown in the

Character Advancement table in chapter 1, not you r level

in a particular class.

So, if you are a cleric 6/fighter 1,

you must gain enough XPto reach 8th level before you

can take you r second level as a fighter or you r seventh

level as a cleric.

### Hit Pointsand Hit Dice

You gain the hit points from you r new class as described

for levels after 1st.

You gain the 1st-level hit points for a

class only when you are a 1st-level character.

You add together the Hit Dice granted by all you r

classes to form you r pool of Hit Dice.

If the Hit Dice are

the same die type, you can simply pool the m together.

For example, both the fighter and the paladin have a

d 10, so if you are a paladin 5/fighter 5, you have ten d 10

Hit Dice.

If you r classes give you Hit Dice ofdifferent

types, keep track of the m separately.

If you are a paladin

5/cleric 5, for example, you have five d 10 Hit Dice and

five d8 Hit Dice.

### Proficiency Bonus

Your proficiency bonus is always based on you r total

character level, as shown in the Character Advancement

table in chapter 1, not you r level in a particular class.

For example, if you are a fighter 3/rogue 2, you have the

proficiency bonus of a 5th-level character, which is +3.

### Proficiencies

W hen you gain a level in a class other than you r first,

you gain only som e of that class’s starting proficiencies,

as shown in the Multiclassing Proficiencies table.

### Class Features

W hen you gain a new level in a class, you get its features

for that level.

A few features, however, have additional

rules when you’re multiclassing: Channel Divinity, Extra

Attack, Unarmored Defense, and Spellcasting.

### Channel Divinity

If you already have the Channel Divinity feature and gain

a level in a class that also grants the feature, you gain the

Channel Divinity effects granted by that class, but getting

the feature again doesn’t give you an additional use of

it.

You gain additional uses only when you reach a class

level that explicitly grants the m to you.

For example, if

you are a cleric 6/paladin 4, you can use Channel Divinity

twice between rests because you are high enough level

in the cleric class to have more uses.

W henever you use

the feature, you can choose any of the Channel Divinity

effects available to you from you r two classes.

### Extra Attack

If you gain the Extra Attack class feature from more

than one class, the features don’t add together.

You

can’t make m ore than two attacks with this feature

unless it says you do (as the fighter’s version of Extra

Attack does).

Similarly, the warlock’s eldritch invocation

Thirsting Blade doesn’t give you additional attacks if you

also have Extra Attack.

### Unarmored Defense

If you already have the Unarmored Defense feature, you

can’t gain it again from another class.

## Spellcasting

### Multiclassing Proficiencies

Your capacity for spellcasting depends partly on you r

com bined levels in all you r spellcasting classes and

partly on you r individual levels in those classes.

Once

you have the Spellcasting feature from m ore than one

class, use the rules below.

If you multiclass but have the

Spellcasting feature from only one class, you follow the

rules as described in that class.

Spells Known and Prepared.

You determine

what spells you know and can prepare for each class

individually, as if you were a single-classed mem ber of

that class.

If you are a ranger 4/wizard 3, for example,

you know three 1st-level ranger spells based on you r

levels in the ranger class.

As 3rd-level wizard, you know

three w izard cantrips, and you r spellbook contains ten

wizard spells, two of which (the two you gained when

you reached 3rd level as a wizard) can be 2nd-level

spells.

If you r Intelligence is 16, you can prepare six

wizard spells from you r spellbook.

Each spell you know and prepare is associated with one

of you r classes, and you use the spellcasting ability of that

class when you cast the spell.

Similarly, a spellcasting

focus, such as a holy symbol, can be used only for the

spells from the class associated with that focus.

Spell Slots.

You determine you r available spell slots

by adding together all you r levels in the bard, cleric,

druid, sorcerer, and wizard classes, half you r levels

(rounded down) in the paladin and ranger classes, and

a third ofyour fighter or rogue levels (rounded down)

if you have the Eldritch Knight or the Arcane Trickster

feature.

Use this total to determine you r spell slots by

consulting the Multiclass Spellcaster table.

If you have m ore than one spellcasting class, this table

might give you spell slots of a level that is higher than

the spells you know or can prepare.

You can use those

slots, but only to cast you r lower-level spells.

If a lower-

level spell that you cast, like burning hands, has an

enhanced effect when cast using a higher-level slot, you

can use the enhanced effect, even though you don’t have

any spells of that higher level.

For example, if you are the aforementioned ranger 4/

wizard 3, you count as a 5th-level character when

determining you r spell slots: you have four 1st-level

slots, three 2nd-level slots, and two 3rd-level slots.

However, you don’t know any 3rd-level spells, nor do you

know any 2nd-level ranger spells.

You can use the spell

slots of those levels to cast the spells you do know—and

potentially enhance the ir effects.

Pact Magic.

If you have both the Spellcasting class

feature and the Pact Magic class feature from the warlock

class, you can use the spell slots you gain from the Pact

Magic feature to cast spells you know or have prepared

from classes with the Spellcasting class feature, and you

can use the spell slots you gain from the Spellcasting

class feature to cast w arlock spells you know.

bonus action to make one m elee weapon attack or to

shove a creature.

If you move at least 10 feet in a straight line

immediately before taking this bonus action, you either

gain a +5 bonus to the attack’s damage roll (if you chose

to make a melee attack and hit) or push the target up

to 10 feet away from you (if you chose to shove and

you succeed).

### Crossbow Expert

Thanks to extensive practice with the crossbow , you

gain the following benefits:

• You ignore the loading quality of crossbow s with

which you are proficient.

• Being with in 5 feet of a hostile creature doesn’t

im pose disadvantage on you r ranged attack rolls.

• W hen you use the Attack action and attack with a one-

### Defensive Duelist

Prerequisite: Dexterity 13 or higher

handed melee w eapons you are wielding aren’t light.

• You can draw or stow two one-handed w eapons when

you w ould normally be able to draw or stow only one.

### Feats

A feat represents a talent or an area of expertise that gives

a character special capabilities.

It embodies training,

experience, and abilities beyond what a class provides.

At certain levels, you r class gives you the Ability Score

Improvement feature.

Using the optional feats rule, you

can forgo taking that feature to take a feat of you r choice

instead.

You can take each feat only once, unless the

feat’s description says otherwise.

You must meet any prerequisite specified in a feat

to take that feat.

If you ever lose a feat’s prerequisite,

you can’t use that feat until you regain the prerequisite.

For example, the Grappler feat requires you to have a

Strength of 13 or higher.

If you r Strength is reduced

below 13 som ehow —perhaps by a with ering curse—

you can’t benefit from the Grappler feat until you r

Strength is restored.

### Alert

following benefits:

• You gain a +5 bonus to initiative.

• You can’t be surprised while you are conscious.

• Other creatures don’t gain advantage on attack rolls

against you as a result of being hidden from you.

You have undergone extensive physical training to gain

the following benefits:

• Increase you r Strength or Dexterity score by 1, to a

maximum of 20.

• W hen you are prone, standing up uses only 5 feet of

you r movement.

## 7. Us In G Ability Sc Or Es

### Ability Scoresand Modifiers

SIX ABILITIES PROVIDE A QUICK DESCRIPTION

of every creature’s physical and mental

characteristics:

• Strength, measuring physical power

• Dexterity, measuring agility

• Constitution, measuring endurance

• Intelligence, measuring reasoning

and m em ory

• Wisdom, measuring perception and insight

• Charisma, measuring force of personality

Is a character muscle-bound and insightful?

Brilliant

and charm ing?

Nimble and hardy?

Ability scores

define the se qualities—a creature’s assets as well

as weaknesses.

The three main rolls of the gam e—the ability check,

the saving throw, and the attack roll—rely on the six

ability scores.

The book’s introduction describes the

basic rule behind the se rolls: roll a d20, add an ability

modifier derived from one of the six ability scores, and

com pare the total to a target number.

This chapter focuses on how to use ability checks

and saving throws, covering the fundamental activities

that creatures attempt in the game.

Rules for attack rolls

appear in chapter 9.

Abil ity Sc ores and

Mod ifie r s

Each of a creature’s abilities has a score, a number that

defines the magnitude of that ability.

An ability score

is not just a measure of innate capabilities, but also

encom passes a creature’s training and com petence in

activities related to that ability.

A score of 10 or 11 is the normal human average, but

adventurers and many monsters are a cut above average

in most abilities.

A score of 18 is the highest that a

person usually reaches.

Adventurers can have scores

as high as 20, and monsters and divine beings can have

scores as high as 30.

Each ability also has a modifier, derived from the

score and ranging from 5 (for an ability score of 1) to

+10 (for a score of 30).

The Ability Scores and M odifiers

table notes the ability m odifiers for the range of possible

ability scores, from 1 to 30.

Score

+10

To determine an ability m odifier with out consulting

the table, subtract 10 from the ability score and the n

divide the total by 2 (round down).

Because ability modifiers affect almost every attack

roll, ability check, and saving throw, ability modifiers

com e up in play m ore often than the ir associated scores.

### Advantageand

D is adv ant age

Som etim es a special ability or spell tells you that you

have advantage or disadvantage on an ability check,

a saving throw, or an attack roll.

W hen that happens,

you roll a second d20 when you make the roll.

Use the

higher of the two rolls if you have advantage, and use

the lower roll if you have disadvantage.

For example, if

you have disadvantage and roll a 17 and a 5, you use the

5.

If you instead have advantage and roll those numbers,

you use the 17.

If multiple situations affect a roll and each one grants

advantage or im poses disadvantage on it, you don’t roll

m ore than one additional d20.

If two favorable situations

grant advantage, for example, you still roll only one

additional d20.

If circum stances cause a roll to have both advantage

and disadvantage, you are considered to have neither of

the m, and you roll one d20.

This is true even if multiple

circum stances im pose disadvantage and only one grants

advantage or vice versa.

In such a situation, you have

neither advantage nor disadvantage.

W hen you have advantage or disadvantage and

som ething in the game, such as the halfling’s Lucky

trait, lets you reroll the d20, you can reroll only one

of the dice.

You choose which one.

For example, if a

halfling has advantage on an ability check and rolls

a 1 and a 13, the halfling could use the Lucky trait to

reroll the 1.

You usually gain advantage or disadvantage through

the use of special abilities, actions, or spells.

Inspiration

(see chapter 4) can also give a character advantage on

checks related to the character’s personality, ideals,

or bonds.

The DM can also decide that circum stances

influence a roll in one direction or the other and grant

advantage or im pose disadvantage as a result.

Pro f ic ie ncy Bon u s

Characters have a proficiency bonus determined by

level, as detailed in chapter 1.

Monsters also have this

bonus, which is incorporated in the ir stat blocks.

The

bonus is used in the rules on ability checks, saving

throws, and attack rolls.

Your proficiency bonus can’t be added to a single die

roll or other number m ore than once.

For example, if

two different rules say you can add you r proficiency

bonus to aWisdom saving throw, you nevertheless add

the bonus only once when you make the save.

Occasionally, you r proficiency bonus might be

multiplied or divided (doubled or halved, for example)

before you apply it.

For example, the rogue's Expertise

feature doubles the proficiency bonus for certain ability

checks.

If a circum stance suggests that you r proficiency

bonus applies m ore than once to the sam e roll, you still

add it only once and multiply or divide it only once.

By the sam e token, if a feature or effect allows you

to multiply you r proficiency bonus when making an

ability check that w ouldn’t normally benefit from you r

proficiency bonus, you still don’t add the bonus to the

check.

For that check you r proficiency bonus is 0, given

the fact that multiplying 0 by any number is still 0.

For

instance, if you lack proficiency in the History skill,

you gain no benefit from a feature that lets you double

you r proficiency bonus when you make Intelligence

(History) checks.

In general, you don’t multiply you r proficiency bonus

for attack rolls or saving throws.

If a feature or effect

allows you to do so, the se same rules apply.

### Ability Checks

An ability check tests a character’s or monster’s innate

talent and training in an effort to overcom eachallenge.

The DM calls for an ability check when a character or

monster attempts an action (other than an attack) that

has a chance of failure.

W hen the outcom e is uncertain,

the dice determine the results.

For every ability check, the DM decides which of the six

abilities is relevant to the task at hand and the difficulty

of the task, represented by a Difficulty Class.

The more

difficult a task, the higher its DC.

The Typical Difficulty

Classes table show s the most com m on DCs.

### Typical Difficulty Classes

Task Difficulty

DC

Very easy

5

Easy

10

Medium

15

Hard

20

Very hard

25

Nearly impossible

30

To make an ability check, roll a d20 and add the

relevant ability modifier.

As with other d20 rolls, apply

bonuses and penalties, and com pare the total to the DC.

If the total equals or exceeds the DC, the ability check

is a success—the creature overcom es the challenge

at hand.

Otherwise, it’safailure, which means the

character or monster makes no progress toward the

objective or makes progress com bined with a setback

determined by the DM.

Con tes t s _______________________________

Som etim es one character’s or monster’s efforts are

directly opposed to another’s.

This can occur when both

of the m are trying to do the sam e thing and only one

can succeed, such as attempting to snatch up a magic

ring that has fallen on the floor.

This situation also

applies when one of the m is trying to prevent the other

one from accom plishing a goal—for example, when a

monster tries to force open a door that an adventurer

is holding closed.

In situations like the se, the outcome

is determined by a special form of ability check,

called a contest.

Both participants in a contest make ability checks

appropriate to the ir efforts.

They apply all appropriate

bonuses and penalties, but instead ofcom paring the

total to a DC, the y com pare the totals of the ir two

checks.

The participant with the higher check total wins

the contest.

That character or monster either succeeds

at the action or prevents the other one from succeeding.

If the contest results in a tie, the situation remains the

same as it was before the contest.

Thus, one contestant

might win the contest by default.

If two characters tie in

a contest to snatch a ring off the floor, neither character

grabs it.

In a contest between a monster trying to open

a door and an adventurer trying to keep the door closed,

a tie means that the door remains shut.

Sk ill s

Each ability covers a broad range of capabilities,

including skills that a character or a monster can be

proficient in.

A skill represents a specific aspect of an

ability score, and an individual’s proficiency in a skill

demonstrates a focus on that aspect. (A character’s

starting skill proficiencies are determined at character

creation, and a monster’s skill proficiencies appear in

the monster’s stat block.)

For example, a Dexterity check might reflect a

character’s attempt to pull off an acrobatic stunt, to palm

an object, or to stay hidden.

Each of the se aspects of

Dexterity has an associated skill: Acrobatics, Sleight of

Hand, and Stealth, respectively.

Soa character w ho has

proficiency in the Stealth skill is particularly good at

Dexterity checks related to sneaking and hiding.

The skills related to each ability score are shown in

the following list. (No skills are related to Constitution.)

S ee an ability’s description in the later sections ofthis

chapter for examples of how to use a skill associated

with an ability.

Som etim es, the DM might ask for an ability check

using a specific skill—for example, “Make aWisdom

(Perception) check.” At other times, a player might ask

the DM if proficiency in a particular skill applies to a

check.

In either case, proficiency in a skill means an

individual can add his or her proficiency bonus to ability

checks that involve that skill.

Without proficiency in the

skill, the individual makes a normal ability check.

Stealth

Intelligence

History

Religion

Wisdom

Anim al Handling

Insight

Medicine

Perform ance

Persuasion

For example, if a character attempts to clim b up a

dangerous cliff, the Dungeon Master might ask for a

Strength (Athletics) check.

If the character is proficient

in Athletics, the character’s proficiency bonus is added

to the Strength check.

If the character lacks that

proficiency, he or she just makes a Strength check.

Var ian t : Ski lls wit hDi ffe ren tAb ili tie s

Normally, you r proficiency in a skill applies only to a

specific kind of ability check.

Proficiency in Athletics,

for example, usually applies to Strength checks.

In som e

situations, though, you r proficiency might reasonably

apply to a different kind of check.

In such cases, the DM

might ask for a check using an unusual combination of

ability and skill, or you might ask you r DM if you can

apply a proficiency to a different check.

For example,

if you have to swim from an offshore island to the

mainland, you r DM might call for a Constitution check

to see if you have the stamina to make it that far.

In this

case, you r DM might allow you to apply you r proficiency

in Athletics and ask for a Constitution (Athletics) check.

Soif you’re proficient in Athletics, you apply you r

proficiency bonus to the Constitution check just as you

would normally do for a Strength (Athletics) check.

Similarly, when you r half-orc barbarian uses a display

of raw strength to intimidate an enemy, you r DM might

ask for a Strength (Intimidation) check, even though

Intimidation is normally associated with Charisma.

Pa ssiv eCh eck s

A passive check is a special kind of ability check that

doesn’t involve any die rolls.

Such a check can represent

the average result for a task done repeatedly, such as

searching for secret doors over and over again, or can

be used when the DM wants to secretly determine

whether the characters succeed at som ething with out

rolling dice, such as noticing a hidden monster.

Here’s how to determine a character’s total for a

passive check:

10 + all modifiers that normally apply to the check

If the character has advantage on the check, add 5.

For

disadvantage, subtract 5.

The game refers to a passive

check total as a score.

For example, if a 1st-level character has aWisdom of

15 and proficiency in Perception, he or she has a passive

W isdom (Perception) score of 14.

The rules on hiding in the “Dexterity” section below

rely on passive checks, as do the exploration rules

in chapter 8.

### Working Together

Som etim es two or m ore characters team up to attempt a

task.

The character w ho’s leading the effort—or the one

with the highest ability m odifier—can make an ability

check with advantage, reflecting the help provided by

the other characters.

In combat, this requires the Help

action (see chapter 9).

A character can only provide help if the task is one that

he or she could attempt alone.

For example, trying to

open a lock requires proficiency with thieves’ tools, so a

character who lacks that proficiency can’t help another

character in that task.

Moreover, a character can help

only when two or more individuals working together

would actually be productive.

Som e tasks, such as

threading a needle, are no easier with help.

### Group Checks

W hen a number of individuals are trying to accom plish

som ething as a group, the DM might ask for a group

ability check.

In such a situation, the characters w ho are

skilled at a particular task help cover those w ho aren't.

To make a group ability check, everyone in the group

m akes the ability check.

If at least half the group

succeeds, the whole group succeeds.

Otherwise,

the group fails.

Group checks don’t com e up very often, and the y’re

most useful when all the characters succeed or

fail as a group.

For example, when adventurers are

navigating a swamp, the DM might call for a group

W isdom (Survival) check to see if the characters can

avoid the quicksand, sinkholes, and other natural

hazards ofthe environment.

If at least half the group

succeeds, the successful characters are able to guide

the ir com panions out of danger.

Otherwise, the group

stumbles into one ofthese hazards.

Usin g Ea chA b il ity

Every task that a character or monster might attempt

in the game is covered by one of the six abilities.

This

section explains in m ore detail what those abilities

mean and the ways the y are used in the game.

St ren gth

Strength m easures bodily power, athletic training, and

the extent to which you can exert raw physical force.

St ren gth Che cks

A Strength check can m odel any attempt to lift, push,

pull, or break something, to force you r body through a

space, or to otherwise apply brute force to a situation.

The Athletics skill reflects aptitude in certain kinds of

Strength checks.

Athletics.

Your Strength (Athletics) check covers

difficult situations you encounter while climbing,

jumping, or swimming.

Examples include the

following activities:

• You attempt to climb a sheer or slippery cliff, avoid

hazards while scaling a wall, or cling to a surface

while som ething is trying to knock you off.

• You try to jum p an unusually long distance or pull

off a stunt midjump.

• You struggle to swim or stay afloat in treacherous cur­

rents, storm -tossed waves, or areas ofthick seaweed.

Or another creature tries to push or pull you underwa­

ter or otherwise interfere with you r swimming.

Other Strength Checks.

The DM might also call for

a Strength check when you try to accom plish tasks like

the following:

• Force open a stuck, locked, or barred door

• Break free of bonds

• Push through a tunnel that is too small

• Hang on to a wagon while being dragged behind it

• Tip over a statue

• Keep a boulder from rolling

### Attack Rollsand Damage

You add you r Strength m odifier to you r attack roll and

you r damage roll when attacking with a melee weapon

such as a mace, a battleaxe, or a javelin.

You use

melee w eapons to make melee attacks in hand-to-hand

combat, and som e of the m can be thrown to make a

ranged attack.

### Liftingand Carrying

Your Strength score determines the amount of weight

you can bear.

The following terms define what you can

lift or carry.

Carrying Capacity.

Your carrying capacity is you r

Strength score multiplied by 15.

This is the weight (in

pounds) that you can carry, which is high enough that

most characters don’t usually have to worry about it.

Push, Drag, or Lift.

You can push, drag, or lift a

weight in pounds up to twice you r carrying capacity

(or 30 times you r Strength score).

W hile pushing or

dragging weight in excess of you r carrying capacity,

you r speed drops to 5 feet.

Size and Strength.

Larger creatures can bear m ore

weight, whereas Tiny creatures can carry less.

For

each size category above Medium, double the creature’s

carrying capacity and the amount it can push, drag, or

lift.

For a Tiny creature, halve the se weights.

Dexterity m easures agility, reflexes, and balance.

### Dexterity Checks

A Dexterity check can model any attempt to move

nimbly, quickly, or quietly, or to keep from falling

on tricky footing.

The Acrobatics, Sleight of Hand,

and Stealth skills reflect aptitude in certain kinds of

Dexterity checks.

Acrobatics.

Your Dexterity (Acrobatics) check covers

you r attempt to stay on you r feet in a tricky situation,

such as when you’re trying to run across a sheet ofice,

balance on a tightrope, or stay upright on a rocking

ship’s deck.

The DM might also call for a Dexterity

(Acrobatics) check to see if you can perform acrobatic

stunts, including dives, rolls, somersaults, and flips.

Var ian t : Enc umb ran c e

The rules for lifting and carrying are intentionally

simple.

Here is a variant if you are looking for m ore

detailed rules for determining how a character is

hindered by the weight of equipment.

W hen you use this

variant, ignore the Strength colum n of the Arm or table

in chapter 5.

If you carry weight in excess of 5 times you r Strength

score, you are encumbered, which means you r speed

drops by 10 feet.

If you carry weight in excess of 10 times you r

Strength score, up to you r m aximum carrying capacity,

you are instead heavily encumbered, which means you r

speed drops by 20 feet and you have disadvantage on

ability checks, attack rolls, and saving throws that use

Strength, Dexterity, or Constitution.

### Dexterity

Sleight of Hand.

W henever you attempt an act of

legerdemain or manual trickery, such as planting

som ething on som eone else or concealing an object on

you r person, make a Dexterity (Sleight ofHand) check.

The DM might also call for a Dexterity (Sleight of Hand)

check to determine whether you can lift a coin purse off

another person or slip som ething out of another

person’s pocket.

Stealth.

Make a Dexterity (Stealth) check when you

attempt to conceal you rself from enemies, slink past

guards, slip away with out being noticed, or sneak up on

som eone with out being seen or heard.

Other Dexterity Checks.

The DM might call for a

Dexterity check when you try to accom plish tasks like

the following:

• Control a heavily laden cart on a steep descent

• Steer a chariot around a tight turn

• Pick a lock

• Disable a trap

• Securely tie up a prisoner

• W riggle free of bonds

• Play a stringed instrument

• Craft a small or detailed object

### Attack Rollsand Damage

You add you r Dexterity modifier to you r attack roll and

you r damage roll when attacking with a ranged weapon,

such as a sling or a longbow.

You can also add you r

Dexterity m odifier to you r attack roll and you r damage

roll when attacking with a melee w eapon that has the

finesse property, such as a dagger or a rapier.

### Hiding

When you try to hide, make a Dexterity (Stealth) check.

Until

you are discovered or you stop hiding, that check’s total is

contested by the Wisdom (Perception) check of any creature

that actively searches for signs of you r presence.

You can’t hide from a creature that can see you, and if you

make noise (such as shouting a warning or knocking over a

vase), you give away you r position.

An invisible creature can’t

be seen, so it can always try to hide.

Signs of its passage

might still be noticed, however, and it still has to stay quiet.

In combat, most creatures stay alert for signs of danger

all around, so if you come out of hiding and approach

a creature, it usually sees you.

However, under certain

circumstances, the Dungeon Master might allow you to stay

hidden as you approach a creature that is distracted, allowing

you to gain advantage on an attack before you are seen.

Passive Perception.

When you hide, the re’sachance

someone will notice you even if the y aren't searching.

To

determine whether such a creature notices you, the DM

compares you r Dexterity (Stealth) check with that creature’s

passive Wisdom (Perception) score, which equals 10 + the

creature’s Wisdom modifier, as well as any other bonuses

or penalties.

If the creature has advantage, add 5.

For

disadvantage, subtract 5.

For example, if a 1st-level character (with a proficiency

bonus o f +2) has a Wisdom of 15 (a +2 modifier) and

proficiency in Perception, he or she has a passive Wisdom

(Perception) of 14.

What Can You See?

One of the main factors in determining

whether you can find a hidden creature or object is how well

you can see in an area, which might be lightly or heavily

obscured, as explained in chapter 8.

### Armor Glass

Depending on the armor you wear, you might add som e

or all of you r Dexterity m odifier to you r Arm or Class,

as described in chapter 5.

### Initiative

At the beginning of every combat, you roll initiative

by making a Dexterity check.

Initiative determines

the order of creatures’ turns in combat, as described

in chapter 9.

### Constitution

Constitution m easures health, stamina, and vital force.

### Constitution Checks

Constitution checks are uncom m on, and no skills apply

to Constitution checks, because the endurance this

ability represents is largely passive rather than involving

a specific effort on the part of a character or monster.

A Constitution check can m odel you r attempt to push

beyond normal limits, however.

The DM might call for a Constitution check when you

try to accom plish tasks like the following:

• Hold you r breath

• March or labor for hours with out rest

• Go with out sleep

• Survive with out food or water

• Quaff an entire stein of ale in one go

### Hit Points

Your Constitution modifier contributes to you r hit

points.

Typically, you add you r Constitution modifier to

each Hit Die you roll for you r hit points.

If you r Constitution m odifier changes, you r hit point

maximum changes as well, as though you had the new

modifier from 1st level.

For example, if you raise you r

Constitution score when you reach 4th level and you r

Constitution m odifier increases from +1 to +2, you

adjust you r hit point maximum as though the modifier

had always been +2.

Soyou add 3 hit points for you r

first three levels, and the n roll you r hit points for 4th

level using you r new modifier.

Or if you’re 7th level and

som e effect lowers you r Constitution score so as to

reduce you r Constitution m odifier by 1, you r hit point

maximum is reduced by 7.

### Intelligence

Intelligence m easures mental acuity, accuracy of recall,

and the ability to reason.

### Intelligence Checks

An Intelligence check com es into play when you need

to draw on logic, education, memory, or deductive

reasoning.

The Arcana, History, Investigation, Nature,

and Religion skills reflect aptitude in certain kinds of

Intelligence checks.

Arcana.

Your Intelligence (Arcana) check m easures

you r ability to recall lore about spells, magic items,

eldritch symbols, magical traditions, the planes of

existence, and the inhabitants of those planes.

History.

Your Intelligence (History) check m easures

you r ability to recall lore about historical events,

legendary people, ancient kingdom s, past disputes,

recent wars, and lost civilizations.

Investigation.

W hen you look around for clues and

make deductions based on those clues, you make an

Intelligence (Investigation) check.

You might deduce the

location of a hidden object, discern from the appearance

ofa wound what kind of weapon dealt it, or determine

the weakest point in a tunnel that could cause it to

collapse.

Poring through ancient scrolls in search of

a hidden fragment of knowledge might also call for an

Intelligence (Investigation) check.

Nature.

Your Intelligence (Nature) check m easures

you r ability to recall lore about terrain, plants and

animals, the weather, and natural cycles.

Religion.

Your Intelligence (Religion) check m easures

you r ability to recall lore about deities, rites and prayers,

religious hierarchies, holy symbols, and the practices

of secret cults.

Other Intelligence Checks.

The DM might call for an

Intelligence check when you try to accom plish tasks like

the following:

• Communicate with a creature with out using words

• Estimate the value of a precious item

• Pull together a disguise to pass as a city guard

• Forge a docum ent

• Recall lore about a craft or trade

• W in a game of skill

### Spellcasting Ability

W izards use Intelligence as the ir spellcasting ability,

which helps determine the saving throw DCs of

spells the y cast.

### Wisdom

W isdom reflects how attuned you are to the world

around you and represents perceptiveness and intuition.

### Wisdom Checks

AWisdom check might reflect an effort to read body

language, understand som eone’s feelings, notice things

about the environment, or care for an injured person.

The Animal Handling, Insight, Medicine, Perception,

and Survival skills reflect aptitude in certain kinds of

W isdom checks.

Animal Handling.

W hen the re is any question

whether you can calm down a domesticated animal,

keep a mount from getting spooked, or intuit an animal’s

intentions, the DM might call for aWisdom (Animal

Handling) check.

You also make aWisdom (Animal

Handling) check to control you r mount when you attempt

a risky maneuver.

Insight.

Your W isdom (Insight) check decides whether

you can determine the true intentions of a creature, such

as w hen searching out a lie or predicting som eone’s

next move.

Doing so involves gleaning clues from body

language, speech habits, and changes in mannerisms.

Medicine.

AWisdom (Medicine) check lets you try to

stabilize a dying com panion or diagnose an illness.

Perception.

Your W isdom (Perception) check lets

you spot, hear, or otherwise detect the presence of

something.

It m easures you r general awareness of

you r surroundings and the keenness of you r senses.

### Findinga Hidden Object

When you r character searches for a hidden object such as

a secret door or a trap, the DM typically asks you to make a

Wisdom (Perception) check.

Such a check can be used to find

hidden details or other information and clues that you might

otherwise overlook.

In most cases, you need to describe where you are looking

in order for the DM to determine you r chance of success.

For

example, a key is hidden beneath a set of folded clothes in

the top drawer of a bureau.

If you tell the DM that you pace

around the room, looking at the walls and furniture for clues,

you have no chance of finding the key, regardless of you r

Wisdom (Perception) check result.

You would have to specify

that you were opening the drawers or searching the bureau in

order to have any chance of success.

For example, you might try to hear a conversation

through a closed door, eavesdrop under an open window,

or hear monsters moving stealthily in the forest.

Or you

might try to spot things that are obscured or easy to

miss, whether the y are orcs lying in ambush on a road,

thugs hiding in the shadows of an alley, or candlelight

under a closed secret door.

Survival.

The DM might ask you to make aWisdom

(Survival) check to follow tracks, hunt wild game, guide

you r group through frozen wastelands, identify signs

that owlbears live nearby, predict the weather, or avoid

quicksand and other natural hazards.

Other Wisdom Checks.

The DM might call for a

W isdom check when you try to accom plish tasks like

the following:

• Get a gut feeling about what course of action to follow

• Discern whether a seem ingly dead or living creature

is undead

### Spellcasting Ability

Clerics, druids, and rangers use W isdom as the ir

spellcasting ability, which helps determine the saving

throw DCs of spells the y cast.

### Charisma

Charisma m easures you r ability to interact effectively

with others.

It includes such factors as confidence

and eloquence, and it can represent a charm ing or

com m and ing personality.

### Charisma Checks

A Charisma check might arise when you try to influence

or entertain others, when you try to make an impression

or tell a convincing lie, or when you are navigating a

tricky social situation.

The Deception, Intimidation,

Perform ance, and Persuasion skills reflect aptitude in

certain kinds of Charisma checks.

Deception.

Your Charisma (Deception) check

determines whether you can convincingly hide the

truth, either verbally or through you r actions.

This

deception can encom pass everything from misleading

others through ambiguity to telling outright lies.

Typical

situations include trying to fast-talk a guard, con a

merchant, earn money through gambling, pass you rself

off in a disguise, dull som eone’s suspicions with false

assurances, or maintain a straight face while telling

a blatant lie.

Intimidation.

W hen you attempt to influence som eone

through overt threats, hostile actions, and physical

violence, the DM might ask you to make a Charisma

(Intimidation) check.

Examples include trying to pry

information out of a prisoner, convincing street thugs

to back down from a confrontation, or using the edge of

a broken bottle to convince a sneering vizier to

reconsider a decision.

Performance.

Your Charisma (Perform ance) check

determines how well you can delight an audience with

music, dance, acting, storytelling, or som e other form of

entertainment.

Persuasion.

W hen you attempt to influence som eone

or a group ofpeople with tact, social graces, or good

nature, the DM might ask you to make a Charisma

(Persuasion) check.

Typically, you use persuasion when

acting in good faith, to foster friendships, make cordial

requests, or exhibit proper etiquette.

Examples of

persuading others include convincing a chamberlain to

let you r party see the king, negotiating peace between

warring tribes, or inspiring a crowd of townsfolk.

Other Charisma Checks.

The DM might call for a

Charisma check when you try to accom plish tasks like

the following:

• Find the best person to talk to for news, rumors,

and gossip

• Blend into a crowd to get the sense ofkey topics

ofconversation

### Spellcasting Ability

Bards, paladins, sorcerers, and w arlocks use Charisma

as the ir spellcasting ability, which helps determine the

saving throw DCs of spells the y cast.

Sa v in gTh row s

A saving throw—also called a save—represents an

attempt to resist a spell, a trap, a poison, a disease, or

a similar threat.

You don’t normally decide to make a

saving throw; you are forced to make one because you r

character or monster is at risk of harm.

To make a saving throw, roll a d20 and add the

appropriate ability modifier.

For example, you use you r

Dexterity modifier for a Dexterity saving throw.

A saving throw can be modified by a situational

bonus or penalty and can be affected by advantage

and disadvantage, as determined by the DM.

Each class gives proficiency in at least two saving

throws.

The wizard, for example, is proficient

in Intelligence saves.

As with skill proficiencies,

proficiency in a saving throw lets a character add his

or her proficiency bonus to saving throws made using

a particular ability score.

Som e monsters have saving

throw proficiencies as well.

The Difficulty Class for a saving throw is determined

by the effect that causes it.

For example, the DC for a

saving throw allowed by a spell is determined by the

caster’s spellcasting ability and proficiency bonus.

The result of a successful or failed saving throw is

also detailed in the effect that allows the save.

Usually,

a successful save m eans that a creature suffers no

harm, or reduced harm, from an effect.

## 8. Adventuring

### Movement

DELVING INTO THE ANCIENT TOMB OF HORRORS.

slipping through the back alleys of

Waterdeep, hacking a fresh trail through

the thick jungles on the Isle of Dread—the se

are the things that Dun geo n s & Dra gon s

adventures are made of.

Your character in

the game might explore forgotten ruins and

uncharted lands, uncover dark secrets and sinister

plots, and slay foul monsters.

And if all goes well, you r

character will survive to claim rich rewards before

embarking on a new adventure.

This chapter covers the basics of the adventuring life,

from the m echanics of movement to the complexities of

social interaction.

The rules for resting are also in this

chapter, along with a discussion of the activities you r

character might pursue between adventures.

W hether adventurers are exploring a dusty dungeon

or the com plex relationships of a royal court, the game

follows a natural rhythm, as outlined in the book’s

introduction:

1.

The DM describes the environment.

2.

The players describe what the y want to do.

3.

The DM narrates the results of the ir actions.

Typically, the DM uses a map as an outline of the

adventure, tracking the characters’ progress as the y

explore dungeon corridors or wilderness regions.

The DM ’s notes, including a key to the map, describe

what the adventurers find as the y enter each new area.

Som etim es, the passage of time and the adventurers’

actions determine what happens, so the DM might

use a timeline or a flowchart to track the ir progress

instead of a map.

T im e

In situations where keeping track of the passage of

time is important, the DM determines the time a task

requires.

The DM might use a different time scale

depending on the context of the situation at hand.

In

a dungeon environment, the adventurers’ movement

happens on a scale of minutes.

It takes the m about a

minute to creep down a long hallway, another minute

to check for traps on the door at the end of the hall, and

a good ten minutes to search the cham ber beyond for

anything interesting or valuable.

In a city or wilderness, a scale of hours is often more

appropriate.

Adventurers eager to reach the lonely tower

at the heart of the forest hurry across those fifteen miles

in just under four hours’ time.

For long journeys, a scale of days works best.

Following the road from Baldur’s Gate to Waterdeep, the

adventurers spend four uneventful days before a goblin

ambush interrupts the ir journey.

In combat and other fast-paced situations, the game

relies on rounds, a 6-second span of time described

in chapter 9.

Swim m ing across a rushing river, sneaking down a

dungeon corridor, scaling a treacherous mountain s lo p e -

all sorts of movement play a key role in D&D adventures.

The DM can sum m arize the adventurers’ movement

with out calculating exact distances or travel times: “You

travel through the forest and find the dungeon entrance

late in the evening of the third day.” Even in a dungeon,

particularly a large dungeon or a cave network, the

DM can summ arize movement between encounters:

“After killing the guardian at the entrance to the ancient

dwarven stronghold, you consult you r map, which leads

you through miles of echoing corridors to a chasm

bridged by a narrow stone arch.”

Som etim es it’s important, though, to know how long

it takes to get from one spot to another, whether the

answer is in days, hours, or minutes.

The rules for

determining travel time depend on two factors: the

speed and travel pace of the creatures moving and the

terrain the y're moving over.

### Speed

Every character and monster has a speed, which is

the distance in feet that the character or monster

can walk in 1 round.

This number assum es short

bursts of energetic movement in the midst of a life-

threatening situation.

The following rules determine how far a character

or monster can move in a minute, an hour, or a day.

Tra vel Pa c e

W hile traveling, a group of adventurers can move at a

normal, fast, or slow pace, as shown on the Travel Pace

table.

The table states how far the party can move in a

period of time and whether the pace has any effect.

A

fast pace m akes characters less perceptive, while a slow

pace makes it possible to sneak around and to search an

area m ore carefully (see the “Activity W hile Traveling”

section later in this chapter for m ore information).

Forced March.

The Travel Pace table assum es that

characters travel for 8 hours in day.

They can push on

beyond that limit, at the risk of exhaustion.

For each additional hour of travel beyond 8 hours,

the characters cover the distance shown in the Hour

colum n for the ir pace, and each character must make

a Constitution saving throw at the end of the hour.

The

DC is 10 + 1 for each hour past 8 hours.

On a failed

saving throw, a character suffers one level of exhaustion

(see appendix A).

Mounts and Vehicles.

For short spans of time (up

to an hour), many animals move much faster than

humanoids.

A mounted character can ride at a gallop

for about an hour, covering twice the usual distance for

a fast pace.

If fresh mounts are available every 8 to 10

miles, characters can cover larger distances at this pace,

but this is very rare except in densely populated areas.

Characters in wagons, carriages, or other land

vehicles choose a pace as normal.

Characters in a

waterborne vessel are limited to the speed of the vessel

(see chapter 5), and the y don’t suffer penalties for a fast

pace or gain benefits from a slow pace.

Depending on

the vessel and the size of the crew, ships might be able

to travel for up to 24 hours per day.

Certain special mounts, such as a pegasus or griffon,

or special vehicles, such as a carpet of flying, allow you

to travel m ore swiftly.

The Dungeon Master’s Guide

contains m ore information on special m ethods of travel.

### Difficult Terrain

The travel speeds given in the Travel Pace table

assume relatively simple terrain: roads, open plains,

or clear dungeon corridors.

But adventurers often face

dense forests, deep swamps, rubble-filled ruins, steep

mountains, and ice-covered ground—all considered

difficult terrain.

You move at half speed in difficult terrain—moving

1 foot in difficult terrain costs 2 feet of speed—so you

can cover only half the normal distance in a minute,

an hour, or a day.

### Special Typesof Movement

Movement through dangerous dungeons or wilderness

areas often involves m ore than simply walking.

Adventurers might have to climb, crawl, swim, or jum p

to get where the y need to go.

Cli mbi n g , Swi mmi n g , and Cra wli n g

W hile climbing or swimming, each foot of movement

costs 1 extra foot (2 extra feet in difficult terrain), unless

a creature has a climbing or swim m ing speed.

At the

DM ’s option, clim bing a slippery vertical surface or

one with few handholds requires a successful Strength

(Athletics) check.

Similarly, gaining any distance in

rough water might require a successful Strength

(Athletics) check.

### Jumping

Your Strength determines how far you can jump.

Long Jump.

W hen you make a long jump, you cover a

number of feet up to you r Strength score if you move at

least 10 feet on foot immediately before the jump.

W hen

you make a standing long jump, you can leap only half

that distance.

Either way, each foot you clear on the

jum p costs a foot of movement.

This rule assum es that the height of you r jum p

doesn’t matter, such as a jum p across a stream or

chasm.

At you r DM ’s option, you must succeed on a

DC 10 Strength (Athletics) check to clear a low obstacle

(no taller than a quarter of the jum p’s distance), such as

a hedge or low wall.

Otherwise, you hit it.

W hen you land in difficult terrain, you must succeed

on a DC 10 Dexterity (Acrobatics) check to land on you r

feet.

Otherwise, you land prone.

High Jump.

W hen you make a high jump, you leap

into the air a num ber of feet equal to 3 + you r Strength

m odifier if you move at least 10 feet on foot immediately

before the jump.

W hen you make a standing high jump,

you can jum p only half that distance.

Either way, each

foot you clear on the jum p costs a foot ofmovement.

In

som e circum stances, you r DM might allow you to make

a Strength (Athletics) check to jum p higher than you

normally can.

You can extend you r arms half you r height above

you rself during the jump.

Thus, you can reach above

you a distance equal to the height of the jum p plus 1 1/2

times you r height.

### Activity While Traveling

As adventurers travel through a dungeon or the

wilderness, the y need to remain alert for danger, and

som e characters might perform other tasks to help

the group’s journey.

### Marching Order

The adventurers should establish amarching order.

Amarching order makes it easier to determine which

characters are affected by traps, which ones can spot

hidden enemies, and which ones are the closest to those

enem ies when a fight breaks out.

A character might occupy the front rank, one or m ore

middle ranks, or the back rank.

Characters in the front

and back ranks need enough room to travel side by

side with others in the ir rank.

W hen space is too tight,

the marching order must change, usually by moving

characters to a middle rank.

Fewer Than Three Ranks.

If an adventuring party

arranges its marching order with only two ranks, the y

are a front rank and a back rank.

If the re’s only one rank,

it’s considered a front rank.

St eal t h

W hile traveling at a slow pace, the characters can move

stealthily.

As long as the y’re not in the open, the y can try

to surprise or sneak by other creatures the y encounter.

S ee the rules for hiding in chapter 7.

### Noticing Threats

Use the passive W isdom (Perception) scores of the

characters to determine whether anyone in the group

notices a hidden threat.

The DM might decide that a

threat can be noticed only by characters in a particular

rank.

For example, as the characters are exploring a

maze oftunnels, the DM might decide that only those

characters in the back rank have a chance to hear or

spot a stealthy creature following the group, while

characters in the front and middle ranks cannot.

W hile traveling at a fast pace, characters take a - 5

penalty to the ir passive W isdom (Perception) scores

to notice hidden threats.

Encountering Creatures.

If the DM determines

that the adventurers encounter other creatures while

the y’re traveling, it’s up to both groups to decide what

happens next.

Either group might decide to attack,

initiate a conversation, run away, or wait to see what the

other group does.

Surprising Foes.

If the adventurers encounter a

hostile creature or group, the DM determines whether

the adventurers or the ir foes might be surprised when

com bat erupts.

S ee chapter 9 for m ore about surprise.

### Other Activities

Characters w ho turn the ir attention to other tasks as the

group travels are not focused on watching for danger.

These characters don’t contribute the ir passive W isdom

(Perception) scores to the group’s chance of noticing

hidden threats.

However, a character not watching for

danger can do one of the following activities instead, or

som e other activity with the DM ’s permission.

Navigate.

The character can try to prevent the group

from becom ing lost, making aWisdom (Survival) check

when the DM calls for it. (The Dungeon Master’s Guide

has rules to determine whether the group gets lost.)

Draw a Map.

The character can draw a map

that records the group’s progress and helps the

characters get back on course if the y get lost.

No ability

check is required.

Track.

A character can follow the tracks of another

creature, making aWisdom (Survival) check when the

DM calls for it. (The Dungeon Master’s Guide has rules

for tracking.)

Forage.

The character can keep an eye out for ready

sources of food and water, making aWisdom (Survival)

check when the DM calls for it. (The Dungeon Master’s

Guide has rules for foraging.)

### The Environment

By its nature, adventuring involves delving into places

that are dark, dangerous, and full of mysteries to be

explored.

The rules in this section cover som e of the

most important ways in w hich adventurers interact with

the environment in such places.

The Dungeon Master’s

Guide has rules covering m ore unusual situations.

### Falling

A fall from a great height is one of the most com m on

hazards facing an adventurer.

At the end of a fall, a creature takes 1d6 bludgeoning

damage for every 10 feet it fell, to a maximum of 20d6.

The creature lands prone, unless it avoids taking

damage from the fall.

### Suffocating

A creature can hold its breath for a number of minutes

equal to 1 + its Constitution modifier (minimum

of 30 seconds).

W hen a creature runs out of breath, it can survive for

a number ofrounds equal to its Constitution modifier

(minimum 1 round).

At the start of its next turn, it drops

to 0 hit points and is dying.

Spl itt ing Upt hePa rty

Sometimes, it makes sense to split an adventuring party,

especially if you want one or more characters to scout ahead.

You can form multiple parties, each moving at a different speed.

Each group has its own front, middle, and back ranks.

The drawback to this approach is that the party will be split

into several smaller groups in the event of an attack.

The

advantage is that a small group of stealthy characters moving

slowly might be able to sneak past enemies that clumsier

characters would alert.

A rogue and a monk moving at a slow

pace are much harder to detect when the y leave the ir dwarf

paladin friend behind.

For example, a creature with a Constitution of 14 can

hold its breath for 3 minutes.

If it starts suffocating, it

has 2 rounds to reach air before it drops to 0 hit points.

### Visionand Light

The m ost fundamental tasks of adventuring—noticing

danger, finding hidden objects, hitting an enemy in

combat, and targeting a spell, to name just a few—

rely heavily on a character’s ability to see.

Darkness

and other effects that obscure vision can prove a

significant hindrance.

A given area might be lightly or heavily obscured.

In

a lightly obscured area, such as dim light, patchy fog,

or moderate foliage, creatures have disadvantage on

W isdom (Perception) checks that rely on sight.

A heavily obscured area—such as darkness, opaque

fog, or dense foliage—blocks vision entirely.

A creature

in a heavily obscured area effectively suffers from the

blinded condition (see appendix A).

The presence or absence of light in an environment

creates three categories of illumination: bright light, dim

light, and darkness.

Bright light lets most creatures see normally.

Even

gloom y days provide bright light, as do torches, lanterns,

fires, and other sources of illumination with in a

specific radius.

Dim light, also called shadows, creates a lightly

obscured area.

An area ofdim light is usually a

boundary between a source of bright light, such as

a torch, and surrounding darkness.

The soft light

of twilight and dawn also counts as dim light.

A

particularly brilliant full m oon might bathe the land

in dim light.

Darkness creates a heavily obscured area.

Characters

face darkness outdoors at night (even most moonlit

nights), with in the confines of an unlit dungeon or a

subterranean vault, or in an area of m agical darkness.

### Blindsight

A creature with blindsight can perceive its surroundings

with out relying on sight, with in a specific radius.

Creatures with out eyes, such as oozes, and creatures

with echolocation or heightened senses, such as bats

and true dragons, have this sense.

### Darkvision

Many creatures in the w orlds ofD&D, especially those

that dwell underground, have darkvision.

Within a

specified range, a creature with darkvision can see in

darkness as if the darkness were dim light, so areas

of darkness are only lightly obscured as far as that

creature is concerned.

However, the creature can’t

discern color in darkness, only shades of gray.

### Truesight

A creature with truesight can, out to a specific range,

see in normal and magical darkness, see invisible

creatures and objects, automatically detect visual

illusions and succeed on saving throws against the m,

and perceives the original form of a shapechanger or

a creature that is transformed by magic.

Furthermore,

the creature can see into the Ethereal Plane.

### Foodand Water

Characters who don’t eat or drink suffer the effects of

exhaustion (see appendix A).

Exhaustion caused by lack

of food or water can’t be removed until the character

eats and drinks the full required amount.

### Food

A character needs one pound of food per day and can

m ake food last longer by subsisting on half rations.

Eating half a pound of food in a day counts as half a day

with out food.

A character can go with out food for a number of days

equal to 3 + his or her Constitution modifier (minimum

1).

At the end ofeach day beyond that limit, a character

automatically suffers one level of exhaustion.

A normal day of eating resets the count of days

with out food to zero.

### Water

A character needs one gallon of water per day, or two

gallons per day if the weather is hot.

A character who

drinks only half that much water must succeed on a

DC 15 Constitution saving throw or suffer one level of

exhaustion at the end of the day.

A character with access

to even less water automatically suffers one level of

exhaustion at the end ofthe day.

If the character already has one or m ore levels of

exhaustion, the character takes two levels in either case.

### Interactingwith Objects

A character’s interaction with objects in an environment

is often simple to resolve in the game.

The player tells

the DM that his or her character is doing something,

such a moving a lever, and the DM describes what, if

anything happens.

For example, a character might decide to pull a lever,

which might, in turn, raise a portcullis, cause a room to

flood with water, or open a secret door in a nearby wall.

If the lever is rusted in position, though, a character

might need to force it.

In such a situation, the DM might

call for a Strength check to see whether the character

can wrench the lever into place.

The DM sets the DC for

any such check based on the difficulty of the task.

Characters can also damage objects with the ir

w eapons and spells.

Objects are immune to poison and

psychic damage, but otherwise the y can be affected

by physical and magical attacks much like creatures

can.

The DM determines an object’s Arm or Class and

hit points, and might decide that certain objects have

resistance or immunity to certain kinds of attacks. (It’s

hard to cut a rope with a club, for example.) Objects

always fail Strength and Dexterity saving throws, and

the y are immune to effects that require other saves.

W hen an object drops to 0 hit points, it breaks.

A character can also attempt a Strength check to

break an object.

The DM sets the DC for any such check.

So cia l In ter act io n

Exploring dungeons, overcom ing obstacles, and slaying

m onsters are key parts of D&D adventures.

No less

important, though, are the social interactions that

adventurers have with other inhabitants of the world.

Interaction takes on many forms.

You might need

to convince an unscrupulous thief to confess to som e

m alfeasance, or you might try to flatter a dragon so that

it will spare you r life.

The DM assum es the roles of any

characters w ho are participating in the interaction that

don’t belong to another player at the table.

Any such

character is called a nonplayer character (NPC).

In general terms, an N PC ’s attitude toward you is

described as friendly, indifferent, or hostile.

Friendly

NPCs are predisposed to help you, and hostile ones are

inclined to get in you r way.

It’s easier to get what you

want from a friendly NPC, ofcourse.

Social interactions have two primary aspects:

roleplaying and ability checks.

### Roleplaying

Roleplaying is, literally, the act of playing out a role.

In this case, it’s you as a player determining how you r

character thinks, acts, and talks.

Roleplaying is a part of every aspect ofthe game,

and it com es to the fore during social interactions.

Your character’s quirks, mannerisms, and personality

influence how interactions resolve.

There are two styles you can use when roleplaying

you r character: the descriptive approach and the active

approach.

Most players use a combination of the two

styles.

Use whichever m ix of the two works best for you.

### Descriptive Approachto Roleplaying

W ith this approach, you describe you r character’swords

and actions to the DM and the other players.

Drawing on

you r mental image of you r character, you tell everyone

what you r character does and how he or she does it.

For instance, Chris plays Tordek the dwarf.

Tordek

has a quick temper and blam es the elves of the

Cloakwood for his family’s misfortune.

At a tavern, an

obnoxious elf minstrel sits at Tordek’s table and tries to

strike up a conversation with the dwarf.

Chris says, “Tordek spits on the floor, growls an

insult at the bard, and stomps over to the bar.

He sits

on a stool and glares at the minstrel before ordering

another drink.”

In this example, Chris has conveyed Tordek’smood

and given the DM a clear idea of his character’s

attitude and actions.

W hen using descriptive roleplaying, keep the

following things in mind:

• D escribe you r character’s em otions and attitude.

• Focus on you r character’s intent and how others

might perceive it.

• Provide as much embellishment as you feel

com fortable with.

D on’tworry about getting things exactly right.

Just

focus on thinking about what you r character would do

and describing what you see in you r mind.

### Active Approachto Roleplaying

If descriptive roleplaying tells you r DM and you r fellow

players what you r character thinks and does, active

roleplaying shows the m.

W hen you use active roleplaying, you speak with you r

character’s voice, like an actor taking on a role.

You might

even echo you r character’s movements and body language.

This approach is m ore im mersive than descriptive

roleplaying, though you still need to describe things

that can’t be reasonably acted out.

Going back to the example of Chris roleplaying Tordek

above, here’s how the scene might play out if Chris used

active roleplaying:

Speaking as Tordek, Chris says in a gruff, deep voice,

“I was w ondering why it suddenly sm elled awful in here.

If I wanted to hear anything out ofyou, I'd snap you r

arm and enjoy you r scream s.” In his normal voice, Chris

the n adds, “I get up, glare at the elf, and head to the bar.”

### Resultsof Roleplaying

The DM uses you r character’s actions and attitudes to

determine how an NPC reacts.

A cowardly NPC buckles

under threats of violence.

A stubborn dwarf refuses to

let anyone badger her.

A vain dragon laps up flattery.

W hen interacting with an NPC, pay close attention to

the DM ’s portrayal ofthe N PC ’smood, dialogue, and

personality.

You might be able to determine an N PC ’s

personality traits, ideals, flaws, and bonds, the n play on

the m to influence the N PC ’s attitude.

Interactions in D&D are much like interactions in

real life.

If you can offer N PCs som ething the y want,

threaten the m with som ething the y fear, or play on the ir

sympathies and goals, you can use words to get almost

anything you want.

On the other hand, if you insult a

proud w arrior or speak ill of a noble’s allies, you r efforts

to convince or deceive will fall short.

### Ability Checks

In addition to roleplaying, ability checks are key in

determining the outcom e of an interaction.

Your roleplaying efforts can alter an N PC’s attitude,

but the re might still be an element of chance in the

situation.

For example, you r DM can call for a Charisma

check at any point during an interaction if he or she

wants the dice to play a role in determining an N PC ’s

reactions.

Other checks might be appropriate in certain

situations, at you r DM ’s discretion.

Pay attention to you r skill proficiencies when thinking

of how you want to interact with an NPC, and stack

the deck in you r favor by using an approach that relies

on you r best bonuses and skills.

If the group needs to

trick a guard into letting the m into a castle, the rogue

w ho is proficient in Deception is the best bet to lead the

discussion.

W hen negotiating for a hostage’s release,

the cleric with Persuasion should do most of the talking.

Res t in g

H eroic though the y might be, adventurers can’t spend

every hour ofthe day in the thick of exploration, social

interaction, and combat.

They need rest—time to

sleep and eat, tend the ir wounds, refresh the ir minds

and spirits for spellcasting, and brace the mselves for

further adventure.

Adventurers can take short rests in the midst of an

adventuring day and a long rest to end the day.

### Short Rest

A short rest is a period of downtime, at least 1 hour long,

during which a character does nothing m ore strenuous

than eating, drinking, reading, and tending to wounds.

A character can spend one or m ore Hit Dice at the end

of a short rest, up to the character’s maximum number

of Hit Dice, which is equal to the character's level.

For

each Hit Die spent in this way, the player rolls the die

and adds the character’s Constitution modifier to it.

The

character regains hit points equal to the total.

The player

can decide to spend an additional Hit Die after each roll.

A character regains som e spent Hit Dice upon finishing

a long rest, as explained below.

### Long Rest

A long rest is a period of extended downtime, at least 8

hours long, during which a character sleeps or perform s

light activity: reading, talking, eating, or standing watch

for no m ore than 2 hours.

If the rest is interrupted by a

period of strenuous activity—at least 1 hour of walking,

fighting, casting spells, or similar adventuring activity—

the characters must begin the rest again to gain any

benefit from it.

At the end of a long rest, a character regains all lost

hit points.

The character also regains spent Hit Dice, up

to a number of dice equal to half of the character’s total

number of the m.

For example, if a character has eight

Hit Dice, he or she can regain four spent Hit Dice upon

finishing a long rest.

A character can’t benefit from m ore than one long rest

in a 24-hour period, and a character must have at least

1 hit point at the start of the rest to gain its benefits.

### Between Adventures

Between trips to dungeons and battles against ancient

evils, adventurers need time to rest, recuperate, and

prepare for the ir next adventure.

Many adventurers also

use this time to perform other tasks, such as crafting

arms and armor, perform ing research, or spending

the ir hard-earned gold.

In som e cases, the passage oftime is som ething that

occurs with little fanfare or description.

W hen starting

a new adventure, the DM might simply declare that a

certain amount of time has passed and allow you to

describe in general terms what you r character has

been doing.

At other times, the DM might want to keep

track of just how much time is passing as events beyond

you r perception stay in motion.

### Lifestyle Expenses

Between adventures, you choose a particular quality

of life and pay the cost of maintaining that lifestyle, as

described in chapter 5.

Living a particular lifestyle doesn’t have a huge effect

on you r character, but you r lifestyle can affect the way

other individuals and groups react to you.

For example,

when you lead an aristocratic lifestyle, it might be easier

for you to influence the nobles of the city than if you

live in poverty.

### Downtime Activities

Between adventures, the DM might ask you what you r

character is doing during his or her downtime.

Periods

of downtime can vary in duration, but each downtime

activity requires a certain number of days to complete

before you gain any benefit, and at least 8 hours of each

day must be spent on the downtime activity for the day

to count.

The days do not need to be consecutive.

If you

have m ore than the minim um amount of days to spend,

you can keep doing the same thing for a longer period

of time, or switch to a new downtime activity.

Downtim e activities other than the ones presented

below are possible.

If you want you r character to spend

his or her downtime perform ing an activity not covered

here, discuss it with you r DM.

### Crafting

You can craft nonm agical objects, including adventuring

equipment and w orks of art.

You must be proficient

with tools related to the object you are trying to create

(typically artisan’s tools).

You might also need access to

special materials or locations necessary to create it.

For

example, som eone proficient with smith’s tools needs a

forge in order to craft a sword or suit of armor.

For every day of downtime you spend crafting, you

can craft one or m ore items with a total market value

not exceeding 5 gp, and you must expend raw materials

worth half the total market value.

If som ething you

want to craft has a market value greater than 5 gp, you

make progress every day in 5-gp increments until you

reach the market value of the item.

For example, a suit

of plate arm or (market value 1,500 gp) takes 300 days

to craft by you rself.

Multiple characters can com bine the ir efforts toward

the crafting of a single item, provided that the characters

all have proficiency with the requisite tools and are

working together in the same place.

Each character

contributes 5 gp worth of effort for every day spent

helping to craft the item.

For example, three characters

with the requisite tool proficiency and the proper

facilities can craft a suit ofplate armor in 100 days,

at a total cost o f 750 gp.

W hile crafting, you can maintain amodest lifestyle

with out having to pay 1 gp per day, or a comfortable

lifestyle at half the normal cost (see chapter 5 for more

information on lifestyle expenses).

### Practicinga Profession

You can work between adventures, allowing you to

maintain a modest lifestyle with out having to pay 1 gp

per day (see chapter 5 for more information on lifestyle

expenses).

This benefit lasts as long you continue to

practice you r profession.

If you are amem ber of an organization that can

provide gainful employment, such as a temple or a

thieves’ guild, you earn enough to support a com fortable

lifestyle instead.

If you have proficiency in the Perform ance skill and

put you r perform ance skill to use during you r downtime,

you earn enough to support a wealthy lifestyle instead.

### Recuperating

You can use downtime between adventures to recover

from a debilitating injury, disease, or poison.

After three days of downtime spent recuperating,

you can make a DC 15 Constitution saving throw.

On a successful save, you can choose one of the

following results:

• End one effect on you that prevents you from regain­

ing hit points.

• For the next 24 hours, gain advantage on saving

throws against one disease or poison currently

affecting you.

### Researching

The time between adventures is a great chance to

perform research, gaining insight into mysteries

that have unfurled over the course ofthe campaign.

Research can include poring over dusty tom es and

crumbling scrolls in a library or buying drinks for the

locals to pry rum ors and gossip from the ir lips.

W hen you begin you r research, the DM determines

whether the information is available, how many days of

downtime it will take to find it, and whether the re are

any restrictions on you r research (such as needing to

seek out a specific individual, tome, or location).

The

DM might also require you to make one or m ore ability

checks, such as an Intelligence (Investigation) check

to find clues pointing toward the information you seek,

or a Charisma (Persuasion) check to secure som eone’s

aid.

Once those conditions are met, you learn the

information if it is available.

For each day of research, you must spend 1 gp to

cover you r expenses.

This cost is in addition to you r

normal lifestyle expenses (as discussed in chapter 5).

### Training

You can spend time between adventures learning a new

language or training with a set of tools.

Your DM might

allow additional training options.

First, you must find an instructor will ing to teach you.

The DM determines how long it takes, and whether one

or m ore ability checks are required.

The training lasts for 250 days and costs 1 gp per day.

After you spend the requisite amount of time and money,

you learn the new language or gain proficiency with

the new tool.

## 9. Combat

### Surprise

THE CLATTER OF A SWORD STRIKING AGAINST

a shield.

The terrible rending sound as

m onstrous claws tear through armor.

A

brilliant flash of light as a ball of flame

blossom s from awizard’s spell.

The sharp

tang of blood in the air, cutting through

the stench of vile monsters.

Roars of fury,

shouts of triumph, cries of pain.

Combat in D&D can be

chaotic, deadly, and thrilling.

This chapter provides the rules you need for you r

characters and m onsters to engage in combat, whether

it is a brief skirm ish or an extended conflict in a

dungeon or on a field ofbattle.

Throughout this chapter,

the rules address you, the player or Dungeon Master.

The Dungeon Master controls all the monsters and

nonplayer characters involved in combat, and each other

player controls an adventurer. “You” can also mean the

character or monster that you control.

The O rder of Com bat

A typical com bat encounter is a clash between two

sides, a flurry of w eapon swings, feints, parries,

footwork, and spellcasting.

The game organizes the

chaos of combat into a cycle of rounds and turns.

A

round represents about 6 seconds in the game world.

During a round, each participant in a battle takes a

turn.

The order of turns is determined at the beginning

of a com bat encounter, when everyone rolls initiative.

Once everyone has taken a turn, the fight continues to

the next round if neither side has defeated the other.

A band of adventurers sneaks up on a bandit camp,

springing from the trees to attack the m.

A gelatinous

cube glides down a dungeon passage, unnoticed by

the adventurers until the cube engulfs one of the m.

In

the se situations, one side of the battle gains surprise

over the other.

The DM determines w ho might be surprised.

If

neither side tries to be stealthy, the y automatically notice

each other.

Otherwise, the DM com pares the Dexterity

(Stealth) checks of anyone hiding with the passive

W isdom (Perception) score of each creature on the

### Combat Stepby Step

1.

Determine surprise.

The DM determines whether anyone

involved in the combat encounter is surprised.

2.

Establish positions.

The DM decides where all the

characters and monsters are located.

Given the

adventurers’ marching order or the ir stated positions in

the room or other location, the DM figures out where the

adversaries are— how far away and in what direction.

3.

Roll initiative.

Everyone involved in the combat encounter

rolls initiative, determining the order of combatants’ turns.

4.

Take turns.

Each participant in the battle takes a turn in

initiative order.

5.

Begin the next round.

When everyone involved in the

combat has had a turn, the round ends.

Repeat step 4 until

the fighting stops.

opposing side.

Any character or monster that doesn’t

notice a threat is surprised at the start of the encounter.

If you’re surprised, you can’t move or take an action

on you r first turn of the combat, and you can’t take a

reaction until that turn ends.

Amem ber of a group can

be surprised even if the other m em bers aren’t.

### Initiative

Initiative determines the order of turns during combat.

W hen combat starts, every participant makes a

Dexterity check to determine the ir place in the initiative

order.

The DM makes one roll for an entire group of

identical creatures, so each m em ber of the group acts at

the same time.

The DM ranks the combatants in order from the one

with the highest Dexterity check total to the one with

the lowest.

This is the order (called the initiative order)

in which the y act during each round.

The initiative order

remains the same from round to round.

If a tie occurs, the DM decides the order among

tied DM-controlled creatures, and the players decide

the order am ong the ir tied characters.

The DM can

decide the order if the tie is between a monster and a

player character.

Optionally, the DM can have the tied

characters and monsters each roll a d20 to determine

the order, highest roll going first.

### Your Turn

On you r turn, you can move a distance up to you r speed

and take one action.

You decide whether to move first

or take you r action first.

Your speed—som etim es called

you r walking speed—is noted on you r character sheet.

The most com m on actions you can take are described

in the “Actions in Com bat” section later in this chapter.

Many class features and other abilities provide

additional options for you r action.

The “Movement and Position” section later in this

chapter gives the rules for you r move.

You can forgo moving, taking an action, or doing

anything at all on you r turn.

If you can’t decide what to

do on you r turn, consider taking the Dodge or Ready

action, as described in “Actions in Combat.”

### Bonus Actions

Various class features, spells, and other abilities let you

take an additional action on you r turn called a bonus

action.

The Cunning Action feature, for example, allows

a rogue to take a bonus action.

You can take a bonus

action only when a special ability, spell, or other feature

of the game states that you can do som ething as a bonus

action.

You otherwise don’t have a bonus action to take.

You can take only one bonus action on you r turn, so

you must choose which bonus action to use w hen you

have m ore than one available.

You choose when to take a bonus action during you r

turn, unless the bonus action’s timing is specified, and

anything that deprives you of you r ability to take actions

also prevents you from taking a bonus action.

### Other Activityon Your Turn

Your turn can include a variety of flourishes that require

neither you r action nor you r move.

You can com m unicate however you are able, through

brief utterances and gestures, as you take you r turn.

You can also interact with one object or feature of the

environment for free, during either you r move or you r

action.

For example, you could open a door during you r

move as you stride toward a foe, or you could draw you r

weapon as part of the sam e action you use to attack.

If you want to interact with a second object, you need

to use you r action.

S om e magic items and other special

objects always require an action to use, as stated

in the ir descriptions.

The DM might require you to use an action for any

of the se activities w hen it needs special care or when it

presents an unusual obstacle.

For instance, the DM

could reasonably expect you to use an action to open a

stuck door or turn a crank to lower a drawbridge.

### Reactions

Certain special abilities, spells, and situations allow

you to take a special action called a reaction.

A reaction

is an instant response to a trigger of som e kind, which

can occur on you r turn or on som eone else’s.

The

opportunity attack, described later in this chapter, is the

most com m on type of reaction.

W hen you take a reaction, you can’t take another one

until the start of you r next turn.

If the reaction interrupts

another creature’s turn, that creature can continue its

turn right after the reaction.

Mov eme nta ndPo s it io n

In combat, characters and m onsters are in constant

motion, often using movement and position to gain

the upper hand.

### Interactingwith Objects Around You

Here are a few examples of the sorts of thing you can do in

tandem with you r movement and action:

• draw or sheathe a sword

• open or close a door

• with draw a potion from you r backpack

• pick up a dropped axe

• take a bauble from a table

• remove a ring from you r finger

• stuff some food into you r mouth

• plant a banner in the ground

• fish a few coins from you r belt pouch

• drink all the ale in a flagon

• throw a lever or a switch

• pull a torch from a sconce

• take a book from a shelf you can reach

• extinguish a small flame

• don a mask

• pull the hood of you r cloak up and over you r head

• put you r ear to a door

• kick a small stone

• turn a key in a lock

• tap the floor with a 10-foot pole

• hand an item to another character

On you r turn, you can move a distance up to you r

speed.

You can use as much or as little of you r speed as

you like on you r turn, following the rules here.

Your movement can include jumping, climbing, and

swimming.

These different m odes of movement can

be com bined with walking, or the y can constitute you r

entire move.

However you’re moving, you deduct the

distance of each part of you r move from you r speed until

it is used up or until you are done moving.

The “Special Types of Movement’’ section in

chapter 8 gives the particulars for jumping, climbing,

and swimming.

### Breaking Up Your Move

You can break up you r movement on you r turn, using

som e of you r speed before and after you r action.

For

example, if you have a speed of 30 feet, you can move

10 feet, take you r action, and the n move 20 feet.

### Movingbetween Attacks

If you take an action that includes m ore than one

weapon attack, you can break up you r movement even

further by moving between those attacks.

For example,

a fighter w ho can make two attacks with the Extra

Attack feature and who has a speed of 25 feet could

move 10 feet, make an attack, move 15 feet, and the n

attack again.

Usin gDi ffe ren tSp eed s

If you have m ore than one speed, such as you r walking

speed and a flying speed, you can switch back and forth

between you r speeds during you r move.

W henever you

switch, subtract the distance you've already m oved from

the new speed.

The result determines how much farther

you can move.

If the result is 0 or less, you can’t use the

new speed during the current move.

For example, if you have a speed of 30 and a flying

speed of 60 because a wizard cast the fly spell on you,

you could fly 20 feet, the n walk 10 feet, and the n leap

into the air to fly 30 feet more.

### Difficult Terrain

Combat rarely takes place in bare room s or on

featureless plains.

Boulder-strewn caverns, briar-

choked forests, treacherous staircases—the setting of

a typical fight contains difficult terrain.

Every foot of movement in difficult terrain costs 1

extra foot.

This rule is true even if multiple things in

a space count as difficult terrain.

Low furniture, rubble, undergrowth, steep stairs,

snow, and shallow bogs are examples ofdifficult terrain.

The space of another creature, whether hostile or not,

also counts as difficult terrain.

### Being Prone

Combatants often find the mselves lying on the ground,

either because the y are knocked down or because the y

throw the mselves down.

In the game, the y are prone,

a condition described in appendix A.

You can drop prone with out using any of you r

speed.

Standing up takes m ore effort; doing so costs

an amount of movement equal to half you r speed.

For

example, if you r speed is 30 feet, you must spend 15 feet

of movement to stand up.

You can’t stand up if you don’t

have enough movement left or if you r speed is 0.

To move while prone, you must crawl or use magic

such as teleportation.

Every foot of movement while

crawling costs 1 extra foot.

Crawling 1 foot in difficult

terrain, the refore, costs 3 feet of movement.

### Creatures

You can move through a nonhostile creature’s space.

In contrast, you can move through a hostile creature's

space only if the creature is at least two sizes larger or

smaller than you.

Rem em ber that another creature’s

space is difficult terrain for you.

W hether a creature is a friend or an enemy, you can’t

will ingly end you r move in its space.

If you leave a hostile creature’s reach during you r

move, you provoke an opportunity attack, as explained

later in the chapter.

### Flying Movement

Flying creatures enjoy many benefits of mobility, but

the y must also deal with the danger of falling.

If a flying

creature is knocked prone, has its speed reduced to 0, or

is otherwise deprived of the ability to move, the creature

falls, unless it has the ability to hover or it is being held

aloft by magic, such as by the fly spell.

### Creature Size

Each creature takes up a different amount of space.

The Size Categories table shows how much space

a creature ofa particular size controls in combat.

Objects som etim es use the same size categories.

### Size Categories

Size

Space

Tiny

2 1/2 by 2 1/2 ft

Small

5 by 5 ft.

Medium

5 by 5 ft.

Large

10 by 10 ft.

Huge

15 by 15 ft.

Gargantuan

20 by 20 ft. or larger

### Space

A creature's space is the area in feet that it effectively

controls in combat, not an expression of its physical

dim ensions.

A typical M edium creature isn't 5 feet

wide, for example, but it does control a space that

wide.

If aMedium hobgoblin stands in a 5-foot-wide

doorway, other creatures can’t get through unless the

hobgoblin lets the m.

A creature’s space also reflects the area it needs to

fight effectively.

For that reason, the re’salimit to the

number of creatures that can surround another creature

in combat.

Assum ing Medium combatants, eight

creatures can fit in a 5-foot radius around another one.

Because larger creatures take up m ore space, fewer

ofthem can surround a creature.

If five Large creatures

Var ian t : Pla y in gon aGr id

If you play out a combat using a square grid and miniatures

or other tokens, follow the se rules.

Squares.

Each square on the grid represents 5 feet.

Speed.

Rather than moving foot by foot, move square by

square on the grid.

This means you use you r speed in 5-foot

segments.

This is particularly easy if you translate you r speed

into squares by dividing the speed by 5.

For example, a speed

of 30 feet translates into a speed of 6 squares.

If you use a grid often, consider writing you r speed in

squares on you r character sheet.

Entering a Square.

To enter a square, you must have

at least 1 square of movement left, even if the square is

diagonally adjacent to the square you’re in. (The rule for

diagonal movement sacrifices realism for the sake of smooth

play.

The Dungeon M aster’s Guide provides guidance on using

a more realistic approach.)

If a square costs extra movement, as a square of difficult

terrain does, you must have enough movement left to pay for

entering it.

For example, you must have at least 2 squares of

movement left to enter a square of difficult terrain.

Corners.

Diagonal movement can’t cross the corner of a

wall, large tree, or other terrain feature that fills its space.

Ranges.

To determine the range on a grid between two

things— whether creatures or objects— start counting squares

from a square adjacent to one of the m and stop counting in

the space of the other one.

Count by the shortest route.

crowd around a Medium or smaller one, the re’s little

room for anyone else.

In contrast, as many as twenty

Medium creatures can surround a Gargantuan one.

### Squeezingintoa Smaller Space

A creature can squeeze through a space that is large

enough for a creature one size smaller than it.

Thus, a

Large creature can squeeze through a passage that's

only 5 feet wide.

W hile squeezing through a space,

a creature must spend 1 extra foot for every foot it

moves the re, and it has disadvantage on attack rolls

and Dexterity saving throws.

Attack rolls against the

creature have advantage while it’s in the smaller space.

Act io nsin Com bat

W hen you take you r action on you r turn, you can take

one of the actions presented here, an action you gained

from you r class or a special feature, or an action that

you improvise.

Many monsters have action options of

the ir own in the ir stat blocks.

W hen you describe an action not detailed elsewhere

in the rules, the DM tells you whether that action is

possible and what kind ofroll you need to make, if any,

to determine success or failure.

### Attack

The most com m on action to take in combat is the Attack

action, whether you are swinging a sword, firing an

arrow from a bow, or brawling with you r fists.

With this action, you make one melee or ranged

attack.

See the “Making an Attack” section for the rules

that govern attacks.

Certain features, such as the Extra Attack feature

of the fighter, allow you to make m ore than one attack

with this action.

### Casta Spell

Spellcasters such as w izards and clerics, as well as

many monsters, have access to spells and can use

the m to great effect in combat.

Each spell has a casting

time, which specifies whether the caster must use an

action, a reaction, minutes, or even hours to cast the

spell.

Casting a spell is, the refore, not necessarily an

action.

Most spells do have a casting time of 1 action,

so a spellcaster often uses his or her action in combat

to cast such a spell.

See chapter 10 for the rules

on spellcasting.

### Dash

W hen you take the Dash action, you gain extra

movement for the current turn.

The increase equals

you r speed, after applying any modifiers.

With a speed

of 30 feet, for example, you can move up to 60 feet on you r

turn if you dash.

Any increase or decrease to you r speed changes this

additional movement by the same amount.

If you r speed

of 30 feet is reduced to 15 feet, for instance, you can

move up to 30 feet this turn if you dash.

### Dis

e

n

g

a

g

e

If you take the Disengage action, you r movement doesn’t

provoke opportunity attacks for the rest of the turn.

### Dodge

W hen you take the Dodge action, you focus entirely on

avoiding attacks.

Until the start of you r next turn, any

attack roll made against you has disadvantage if you

can see the attacker, and you make Dexterity saving

throws with advantage.

You lose this benefit if you are

incapacitated (as explained in appendix A) or if you r

speed drops to 0.

### Help

You can lend you r aid to another creature in the

completion of a task.

W hen you take the Help action,

the creature you aid gains advantage on the next ability

check it makes to perform the task you are helping with,

provided that it makes the check before the start of

you r next turn.

Alternatively, you can aid a friendly creature in

attacking a creature with in 5 feet of you.

You feint,

distract the target, or in som e other way team up to

make you r ally’s attack m ore effective.

If you r ally

attacks the target before you r next turn, the first attack

roll is made with advantage.

### Hide

W hen you take the Hide action, you make a Dexterity

(Stealth) check in an attempt to hide, following the rules

in chapter 7 for hiding.

If you succeed, you gain certain

benefits, as described in the “Unseen Attackers and

Targets” section later in this chapter.

### Makingan Attack

Im pro vis ing anA cti o n

Your character can do things not covered by the actions in

this chapter, such as breaking down doors, intimidating

enemies, sensing weaknesses in magical defenses, or calling

for a parley with a foe.

The only limits to the actions you can

attempt are you r imagination and you r character’s ability

scores.

See the descriptions of the ability scores in chapter 7

for inspiration as you improvise.

When you describe an action not detailed elsewhere in

the rules, the DM tells you whether that action is possible

and what kind of roll you need to make, if any, to determine

success or failure.

### Search

W hen you take the Search action, you devote you r

attention to finding something.

Depending on the

nature of you r search, the DM might have you make

aWisdom (Perception) check or an Intelligence

(Investigation) check.

### Usean Object

You normally interact with an object while doing

som ething else, such as when you draw a sword as part

of an attack.

W hen an object requires you r action for

its use, you take the Use an Object action.

This action

is also useful when you want to interact with m ore than

one object on you r turn.

W hether you’re striking with a melee weapon, firing a

w eapon at range, or making an attack roll as part of a

spell, an attack has a simple structure.

Som etim es you want to get the jum p on a foe or wait for

a particular circum stance before you act.

To do so, you

can take the Ready action on you r turn so that you can

act later in the round using you r reaction.

First, you decide what perceivable circum stance

will trigger you r reaction.

Then, you choose the action

you will take in response to that trigger, or you choose

to move up to you r speed in response to it.

Examples

include “If the cultist steps on the trapdoor, I’ll pull the

lever that opens it,” and “If the goblin steps next to me,

I move away.”

W hen the trigger occurs, you can either take you r

reaction right after the trigger finishes or ignore

the trigger.

Rem em ber that you can take only one

reaction per round.

W hen you ready a spell, you cast it as normal but

hold its energy, which you release with you r reaction

when the trigger occurs.

To be readied, a spell must

have a casting time of 1 action, and holding onto the

spell’s magic requires concentration (explained in

chapter 10).

If you r concentration is broken, the spell

dissipates with out taking effect.

For example, if you are

concentrating on the web spell and ready magic missile,

you r web spell ends, and if you take damage before

you release magic missile with you r reaction, you r

concentration might be broken.

### Attack Rolls

W hen you make an attack, you r attack roll determines

whether the attack hits or m isses.

To make an attack

roll, roll a d20 and add the appropriate modifiers.

If the

total ofthe roll plus m odifiers equals or exceeds the

target’s Arm or Class (AC), the attack hits.

The AC ofa

character is determined at character creation, whereas

the AC of a monster is in its stat block.

### Modifierstothe Roll

W hen a character makes an attack roll, the two most

com m on modifiers to the roll are an ability modifier

and the character’s proficiency bonus.

W hen a monster

m akes an attack roll, it uses what ever modifier is

provided in its stat block.

Ability Modifier.

The ability modifier used for a melee

weapon attack is Strength, and the ability modifier used

for a ranged weapon attack is Dexterity.

W eapons that

have the finesse or thrown property break this rule.

Som e spells also require an attack roll.

The ability

m odifier used for a spell attack depends on the

spellcasting ability ofthe spellcaster, as explained

in chapter 10.

Proficiency Bonus.

You add you r proficiency bonus

to you r attack roll when you attack using a weapon with

which you have proficiency, as well as when you attack

with a spell.

Rol lin g 1 o r 2 0

Som etim es fate blesses or curses a combatant, causing

the novice to hit and the veteran to miss.

If the d20 roll for an attack is a 20, the attack hits

regardless ofany modifiers or the target’s AC.

In

addition, the attack is a critical hit, as explained later

in this chapter.

If the d20 roll for an attack is a 1, the attack m isses

regardless of any modifiers or the target’s AC.

### Unseen Attackersand Targets

1.

Choose a target.

Pick a target with in you r attack’s

range: a creature, an object, or a location.

2.

Determine modifiers.

The DM determines whether

the target has cover and whether you have advantage

or disadvantage against the target.

In addition, spells,

special abilities, and other effects can apply penalties

or bonuses to you r attack roll.

3.

Resolve the attack.

You make the attack roll.

On a

hit, you roll damage, unless the particular attack has

rules that specify otherwise.

S om e attacks cause

special effects in addition to or instead ofdamage.

If the re’s ever any question whether som ething you’re

doing counts as an attack, the rule is simple: if you’re

making an attack roll, you’re making an attack.

Combatants often try to escape the ir foes’ notice

by hiding, casting the invisibility spell, or lurking

in darkness.

W hen you attack a target that you can’t see, you have

disadvantage on the attack roll.

This is true whether

you’re guessing the target’s location or you’re targeting

a creature you can hear but not see.

If the target isn’t in

the location you targeted, you automatically m iss, but

the DM typically just says that the attack m issed, not

whether you guessed the target’s location correctly.

W hen a creature can’t see you, you have advantage on

attack rolls against it.

If you are hidden—both unseen and unheard—when

you make an attack, you give away you r location when

the attack hits or m isses.

### Ranged At

t

a

c

k

s

W hen you make a ranged attack, you fire a bow or a

crossbow, hurl a handaxe, or otherwise send projectiles

to strike a foe at a distance.

A monster might shoot

spines from its tail.

Many spells also involve making a

ranged attack.

### Range

You can make ranged attacks only against targets with in

a specified range.

If a ranged attack, such as one made with a spell, has a

single range, you can’t attack a target beyond this range.

S om e ranged attacks, such as those made with a

longbow or a shortbow, have two ranges.

The smaller

number is the normal range, and the larger num ber is

the long range.

Your attack roll has disadvantage when

you r target is beyond normal range, and you can’t attack

a target beyond the long range.

### Ranged Attacksin Close Combat

Aiming a ranged attack is m ore difficult when a foe

is next to you.

W hen you make a ranged attack with

a weapon, a spell, or som e other means, you have

disadvantage on the attack roll if you are with in 5 feet

ofa hostile creature who can see you and w ho isn’t

incapacitated.

### Melee Attacks

Used in hand-to-hand combat, a melee attack allows

you to attack a foe with in you r reach.

A melee attack

typically uses a handheld weapon such as a sword,

a warhammer, or an axe.

A typical monster makes a

melee attack when it strikes with its claws, horns, teeth,

tentacles, or other body part.

A few spells also involve

making a melee attack.

M ost creatures have a 5-foot reach and can thus

attack targets with in 5 feet of the m when making a

m elee attack.

Certain creatures (typically those larger

than Medium) have melee attacks with a greater reach

than 5 feet, as noted in the ir descriptions.

W hen you are unarmed, you can fight in melee by

making an unarmed strike, as shown in the weapon

table in chapter 5.

### Opportunity Attacks

In a fight, everyone is constantly watching for enemies

to drop the ir guard.

You can rarely move heedlessly past

you r foes with out putting you rself in danger; doing so

provokes an opportunity attack.

You can make an opportunity attack when a hostile

creature that you can see m oves out of you r reach.

To

make the opportunity attack, you use you r reaction

to make one melee attack against the provoking

Con tes tsin Com bat

Battle often involves pitting you r prowess against that of

you r foe.

Such a challenge is represented by a contest.

This

section includes the most common contests that require an

action in combat: grappling and shoving a creature.

The DM

can use the se contests as models for improvising others.

creature.

The attack interrupts the provoking creature’s

movement, occurring right before the creature

leaves you r reach.

You can avoid provoking an opportunity attack by

taking the Disengage action.

You also don’t provoke an

opportunity attack when you teleport or when som eone

or som ething m oves you with out using you r movement,

action, or reaction.

For example, you don’t provoke an

opportunity attack if an explosion hurls you out of a foe’s

reach or if gravity causes you to fall past an enemy.

Two-Wea pon Fig hti n g

W hen you take the Attack action and attack with a light

melee weapon that you’re holding in one hand, you can

use a bonus action to attack with a different light melee

weapon that you’re holding in the other hand.

You don’t

add you r ability modifier to the damage of the bonus

attack, unless that modifier is negative.

If either weapon has the thrown property, you

can throw the weapon, instead of making a melee

attack with it.

### Grappling

W hen you want to grab a creature or wrestle with it,

you can use the Attack action to make a special melee

attack, a grapple.

If you’re able to make multiple attacks

with the Attack action, this attack replaces one of the m.

The target of you r grapple must be no m ore than one

size larger than you, and it must be with in you r reach.

Using at least one free hand, you try to seize the target

by making a grapple check, a Strength (Athletics)

check contested by the target’s Strength (Athletics) or

Dexterity (Acrobatics) check (the target chooses the

ability to use).

If you succeed, you subject the target to

the grappled condition (see appendix A).

The condition

specifies the things that end it, and you can release the

target when ever you like (no action required).

Escaping a Grapple.

A grappled creature can use its

action to escape.

To do so, it must succeed on a Strength

(Athletics) or Dexterity (Acrobatics) check contested by

you r Strength (Athletics) check.

Moving a Grappled Creature.

W hen you move, you

can drag or carry the grappled creature with you, but

you r speed is halved, unless the creature is two or more

sizes smaller than you.

### Shovinga Creature

Using the Attack action, you can make a special melee

attack to shove a creature, either to knock it prone or

push it away from you.

If you’re able to make multiple

attacks with the Attack action, this attack replaces

one of the m.

The target of you r shove must be no m ore than one

size larger than you, and it must be with in you r reach.

You make a Strength (Athletics) check contested by the

target’s Strength (Athletics) or Dexterity (Acrobatics)

check (the target chooses the ability to use).

If you win

the contest, you either knock the target prone or push

it 5 feet away from you.

### Cover

Walls, trees, creatures, and other obstacles can provide

cover during combat, making a target m ore difficult

to harm.

A target can benefit from cover only when an

attack or other effect originates on the opposite side

of the cover.

There are three degrees of cover.

If a target is behind

multiple sources of cover, only the most protective

degree ofcover applies; the degrees aren't added

together.

For example, if a target is behind a creature

that gives half cover and a tree trunk that gives three-

quarters cover, the target has three-quarters cover.

A target with half cover has a +2 bonus to AC and

Dexterity saving throws.

A target has half cover if an

obstacle blocks at least half of its body.

The obstacle

might be a low wall, a large piece of furniture, a narrow

tree trunk, or a creature, whether that creature is an

enemy or a friend.

A target with three-quarters cover has a +5 bonus

to AC and Dexterity saving throws.

A target has three-

quarters cover if about three-quarters of it is covered

by an obstacle.

The obstacle might be a portcullis, an

arrow slit, or a thick tree trunk.

A target with total cover can’t be targeted directly

by an attack or a spell, although som e spells can reach

such a target by including it in an area of effect.

A

target has total cover if it is completely concealed by

an obstacle.

Dam age and Hea l in g

Injury and the risk of death are constant com panions

of those who explore the w orlds of D&D.

The thrust of

a sword, a well-placed arrow, or a blast of flame from a

fireball spell all have the potential to damage, or even

kill, the hardiest of creatures.

### Hit Points

Hit points represent a combination of physical and

mental durability, the will to live, and luck.

Creatures

with m ore hit points are m ore difficult to kill.

Those

with fewer hit points are m ore fragile.

A creature’s current hit points (usually just called hit

points) can be any number from the creature’s hit point

maximum down to 0.

This number changes frequently

as a creature takes damage or receives healing.

W henever a creature takes damage, that damage is

subtracted from its hit points.

The loss of hit points has

no effect on a creature’s capabilities until the creature

drops to 0 hit points.

### Damage Rolls

Each weapon, spell, and harmful monster ability

specifies the damage it deals.

You roll the damage die

or dice, add any modifiers, and apply the damage to

you r target.

Magic weapons, special abilities, and other

factors can grant a bonus to damage.

W hen attacking with a weapon, you add you r ability

modifier—the same modifier used for the attack roll—

to the damage.

A spell tells you which dice to roll for

damage and whether to add any modifiers.

If a spell or other effect deals damage to more than

one target at the sam e time, roll the damage once for

all of the m.

For example, when a wizard casts fireball or

a cleric casts flame strike, the spell’s damage is rolled

once for all creatures caught in the blast.

Cri tic alH it s

W hen you score a critical hit, you get to roll extra dice

for the attack’s damage against the target.

Roll all of the

attack’s damage dice twice and add the m together.

Then

add any relevant modifiers as normal.

To speed up play,

you can roll all the damage dice at once.

For example, if you score a critical hit with a dagger,

roll 2d4 for the damage, rather than 1d4, and the n add

you r relevant ability modifier.

If the attack involves other

damage dice, such as from the rogue’s Sneak Attack

feature, you roll those dice twice as well.

### Damage Types

Different attacks, damaging spells, and other harmful

effects deal different types of damage.

Damage types

have no rules of the ir own, but other rules, such as

damage resistance, rely on the types.

The damage types follow, with examples to help a

DM assign a damage type to a new effect.

Acid.

The corrosive spray of a black dragon’s breath

and the dissolving enzym es secreted by a black pudding

deal acid damage.

Bludgeoning.

Blunt force attacks—hammers, falling,

constriction, and the like—deal bludgeoning damage.

Cold.

The infernal chill radiating from an ice devil’s

spear and the frigid blast of a white dragon’s breath

deal cold damage.

Fire.

Red dragons breathe fire, and many spells

conjure flames to deal fire damage.

Force.

Force is pure magical energy focused into a

damaging form.

Most effects that deal force damage are

spells, including magic missile and spiritual weapon.

Lightning.

A lightning bolt spell and a blue dragon’s

breath deal lightning damage.

Necrotic.

Necrotic damage, dealt by certain undead

and a spell such as chill touch, with ers matter and

even the soul.

Piercing.

Puncturing and impaling attacks, including

spears and m onsters’ bites, deal piercing damage.

Poison.

Venomous stings and the toxic gas ofa green

dragon’s breath deal poison damage.

Psychic.

Mental abilities such as a mind flayer’s

psionic blast deal psychic damage.

Radiant.

Radiant damage, dealt by a cleric’s flame

strike spell or an angel’s smiting weapon, sears the flesh

like fire and overloads the spirit with power.

Slashing.

Swords, axes, and m onsters’ claws deal

slashing damage.

Thunder.

A concussive burst of sound, such as the

effect ofthe thunderwave spell, deals thunder damage.

### Vulnerability

S om e creatures and objects are exceedingly difficult or

unusually easy to hurt with certain types of damage.

If a creature or an object has resistance to a damage

type, damage of that type is halved against it.

If a

creature or an object has vulnerability to a damage

type, damage of that type is doubled against it.

Resistance and the n vulnerability are applied after

all other modifiers to damage.

For example, a creature

has resistance to bludgeoning damage and is hit by an

attack that deals 25 bludgeoning damage.

The creature

is also with in amagical aura that reduces all damage by

5.

The 25 damage is first reduced by 5 and the n halved,

so the creature takes 10 damage.

Multiple instances of resistance or vulnerability that

affect the sam e damage type count as only one instance.

For example, if a creature has resistance to fire damage

as w ell as resistance to all nonm agical damage, the

damage of a nonm agical fire is reduced by half against

the creature, not reduced by three-quarters.

### Healing

Unless it results in death, damage isn’t permanent.

Even

death is reversible through powerful magic.

Rest can

restore a creature's hit points (as explained in chapter

8), and magical m ethods such as a cure wounds spell or

a potion of healing can remove damage in an instant.

W hen a creature receives healing of any kind, hit

points regained are added to its current hit points.

A

creature’s hit points can’t exceed its hit point maximum,

so any hit points regained in excess of this num ber are

lost.

For example, a druid grants a ranger 8 hit points of

healing.

If the ranger has 14 current hit points and has a

hit point maximum of 20, the ranger regains 6 hit points

from the druid, not 8.

A creature that has died can’t regain hit points until

magic such as the revivify spell has restored it to life.

Dro ppi ngt o 0 Hit Poi nts

W hen you drop to 0 hit points, you either die outright or

fall unconscious, as explained in the following sections.

### Instant Death

Massive damage can kill you instantly.

W hen damage

reduces you to 0 hit points and the re is damage

remaining, you die if the remaining damage equals

or exceeds you r hit point maximum.

For example, a cleric with amaximum of

12 hit points currently has 6 hit points.

If she

takes 18 damage from an attack, she is reduced

to 0 hit points, but 12 damage remains.

Because

the remaining damage equals her hit point

maximum, the cleric dies.

Fa lli ngU nco nsc iou s

If damage reduces you to 0 hit points and fails to kill

you, you fall unconscious (see appendix A).

This

unconsciousness ends if you regain any hit points.

### Describingthe Effectsof Damage

Dungeon Masters describe hit point loss in different ways.

When you r current hit point total is half or more of you r hit

point maximum, you typically show no signs of injury.

When

you drop below half you r hit point maximum, you show signs

of wear, such as cuts and bruises.

An attack that reduces you

to 0 hit points strikes you directly, leaving a bleeding injury or

other trauma, or it simply knocks you unconscious.

Dea thSa vin gTh row s

W henever you start you r turn with 0 hit points, you

must make a special saving throw, called a death saving

throw, to determine whether you creep closer to death

or hang onto life.

Unlike other saving throws, this one

isn’t tied to any ability score.

You are in the hands of fate

now, aided only by spells and features that improve you r

chances of succeeding on a saving throw.

Roll a d20.

If the roll is 10 or higher, you succeed.

Otherwise, you fail.

A success or failure has no effect

by itself.

On you r third success, you becom e stable (see

below).

On you r third failure, you die.

The successes

and failures don't need to be consecutive; keep track

of both until you collect three of a kind.

The number of

both is reset to zero when you regain any hit points or

becom e stable.

Rolling 1 or 20.

W hen you make a death saving throw

and roll a 1 on the d20, it counts as two failures.

If you

roll a 20 on the d20, you regain 1 hit point.

Damage at 0 Hit Points.

If you take any damage while

you have 0 hit points, you suffer a death saving throw

failure.

If the damage is from a critical hit, you suffer

two failures instead.

If the damage equals or exceeds

you r hit point maximum, you suffer instant death.

St abi liz ing aCr eat ure

The best way to save a creature with 0 hit points is to

heal it.

If healing is unavailable, the creature can at

least be stabilized so that it isn’t killed by a failed death

saving throw.

You can use you r action to administer first aid to an

unconscious creature and attempt to stabilize it, which

requires a successful DC 10 W isdom (Medicine) check.

A stable creature doesn’t make death saving throws,

even though it has 0 hit points, but it does remain

unconscious.

The creature stops being stable, and must

start making death saving throws again, if it takes any

damage.

A stable creature that isn’t healed regains

1 hit point after 1d4 hours.

### Monstersand Death

Most DMs have a monster die the instant it drops to

0 hit points, rather than having it fall unconscious and

make death saving throws.

Mighty villains and special nonplayer characters

are com m on exceptions; the DM might have the m

fall unconscious and follow the sam e rules as

player characters.

### Knockinga Creature Out

Som etim es an attacker wants to incapacitate a foe,

rather than deal a killing blow.

W hen an attacker

reduces a creature to 0 hit points with a melee attack,

the attacker can knock the creature out.

The attacker

can make this choice the instant the damage is dealt.

The creature falls unconscious and is stable.

### Temporary Hit Points

Som e spells and special abilities confer temporary hit

points to a creature.

Temporary hit points aren’t actual

hit points; the y are a buffer against damage, a pool of hit

points that protect you from injury.

W hen you have temporary hit points and take damage,

the temporary hit points are lost first, and any leftover

damage carries over to you r normal hit points.

For

example, if you have 5 temporary hit points and take

7 damage, you lose the temporary hit points and the n

take 2 damage.

Because temporary hit points are separate from

you r actual hit points, the y can exceed you r hit point

maximum.

A character can, the refore, be at full hit

points and receive temporary hit points.

Healing can’t restore temporary hit points, and the y

can’t be added together.

If you have temporary hit points

and receive m ore of the m, you decide whether to keep

the ones you have or to gain the new ones.

For example,

if a spell grants you 12 temporary hit points when you

already have 10, you can have 12 or 10, not 22.

If you have 0 hit points, receiving temporary hit points

doesn’t restore you to consciousness or stabilize you.

They can still absorb damage directed at you while

you’re in that state, but only true healing can save you.

Unless a feature that grants you temporary hit points

has a duration, the y last until the y’re depleted or you

finish a long rest.

### Mounted Combat

A knight charging into battle on a warhorse, a wizard

casting spells from the back of a griffon, or a cleric

soaring through the sky on a pegasus all enjoy the

benefits of speed and mobility that a mount can provide.

A will ing creature that is at least one size larger than

you and that has an appropriate anatomy can serve as a

mount, using the following rules.

### Mountingand Dismounting

Once during you r move, you can mount a creature that

is with in 5 feet of you or dismount.

Doing so costs an

amount of movement equal to half you r speed.

For

example, if you r speed is 30 feet, you must spend 15

feet of movement to mount a horse.

Therefore, you can’t

mount it if you don’t have 15 feet ofmovement left or

if you r speed is 0.

If an effect m oves you r mount against its w ill while

you’re on it, you must succeed on a DC 10 Dexterity

saving throw or fall off the mount, landing prone in a

space with in 5 feet of it.

If you’re knocked prone while

mounted, you must make the same saving throw.

If you r mount is knocked prone, you can use you r

reaction to dismount it as it falls and land on you r feet.

Otherwise, you are dismounted and fall prone in a

space with in 5 feet it.

### Controllinga Mount

W hile you're mounted, you have two options.

You

can either control the mount or allow it to act

independently.

Intelligent creatures, such as dragons,

act independently.

You can control a mount only if it has been trained

to accept a rider.

Dom esticated horses, donkeys, and

similar creatures are assum ed to have such training.

The initiative of a controlled mount changes to match

you rs when you mount it.

It m oves as you direct it, and

it has only three action options: Dash, Disengage, and

Dodge.

A controlled mount can move and act even on

the turn that you mount it.

An independent mount retains its place in the

initiative order.

Bearing a rider puts no restrictions on

the actions the mount can take, and it m oves and acts

as it wishes.

It might flee from combat, rush to attack

and devour a badly injured foe, or otherwise act against

you r wishes.

In either case, if the mount provokes an opportunity

attack while you’re on it, the attacker can target you

or the mount.

### Underwater Combat

W hen adventurers pursue sahuagin back to the ir

undersea homes, fight off sharks in an ancient

shipwreck, or find the mselves in a flooded dungeon

room , the y must fight in a challenging environment.

Underwater the following rules apply.

W hen making a melee weapon attack, a creature

that doesn’t have a swim m ing speed (either natural or

granted by magic) has disadvantage on the attack roll

unless the weapon is a dagger, javelin, shortsword,

spear, or trident.

A ranged weapon attack automatically m isses

a target beyond the w eapon’s normal range.

Even

against a target with in normal range, the attack roll has

disadvantage unless the weapon is a crossbow, a net, or

a weapon that is thrown like a javelin (including a spear,

trident, or dart).

Creatures and objects that are fully im m ersed in

water have resistance to fire damage.

## 10. Sp Ellcasting

### Spell Level

M

AGIC PERMEATES THE WORLDS OF D&D AND

most often appears in the form ofa spell.

This chapter provides the rules for

casting spells.

Different character

classes have distinctive ways of learning

and preparing the ir spells, and monsters

use spells in unique ways.

Regardless of its source,

a spell follows the rules here.

Wha tIs a Spell?

A spell is a discrete magical effect, a single shaping

of the magical energies that suffuse the multiverse

into a specific, limited expression.

In casting a spell,

a character carefully plucks at the invisible strands of

raw m agic suffusing the world, pins the m in place in a

particular pattern, sets the m vibrating in a specific way,

and the n releases the m to unleash the desired effect—in

most cases, all in the span ofseconds.

Spells can be versatile tools, weapons, or protective

wards.

They can deal damage or undo it, im pose or

remove conditions (see appendix A), drain life energy

away, and restore life to the dead.

Uncounted thousands of spells have been created

over the course of the multiverse’s history, and many of

the m are long forgotten.

Som e might yet lie recorded in

crumbling spellbooks hidden in ancient ruins or trapped

in the minds of dead gods.

Or the y might som eday be

reinvented by a character who has am assed enough

power and w isdom to do so.

Every spell has a level from 0 to 9.

A spell’s level is a

general indicator of how powerful it is, with the lowly

(but still impressive) magic missile at 1st level and

the earth-shaking wish at 9th.

Cantrips—simple but

powerful spells that characters can cast almost by rote—

are level 0.

The higher a spell’s level, the higher level a

spellcaster must be to use that spell.

Spell level and character level don’t correspond

directly.

Typically, a character has to be at least 17th

level, not 9th level, to cast a 9th-level spell.

### Knownand Prepared Spells

Before a spellcaster can use a spell, he or she must

have the spell firmly fixed in mind, or must have access

to the spell in a magic item.

M embers ofa few classes,

including bards and sorcerers, have a limited list of

spells the y know that are always fixed in mind.

The

same thing is true ofmany magic-using monsters.

Other

spellcasters, such as clerics and wizards, undergo a

process ofpreparing spells.

This process varies for

different classes, as detailed in the ir descriptions.

Cas tin g in Arm o r

Because of the mental focus and precise gestures required

for spellcasting, you must be proficient with the armor you

are wearing to cast a spell.

You are otherwise too distracted

and physically hampered by you r armor for spellcasting.

In every case, the number ofspells a caster can

have fixed in mind at any given time depends on the

character’s level.

### Spell Slots

Regardless of how many spells a caster knows or

prepares, he or she can cast only a limited num ber of

spells before resting.

Manipulating the fabric of magic

and channeling its energy into even a simple spell is

physically and mentally taxing, and higher-level spells

are even m ore so.

Thus, each spellcasting class’s

description (except that of the warlock) includes a table

showing how many spell slots of each spell level a

character can use at each character level.

For example,

the 3rd-level wizard Umara has four 1st-level spell slots

and two 2nd-level slots.

W hen a character casts a spell, he or she expends

a slot of that spell’s level or higher, effectively “filling”

a slot with the spell.

You can think of a spell slot as a

groove of a certain size—small for a 1st-level slot, larger

for a spell of higher level.

A 1st-level spell fits into a slot

of any size, but a 9th-level spell fits only in a 9th-level

slot.

Sowhen Umara casts magic missile, a 1st-level

spell, she spends one of her four 1st-level slots and has

three remaining.

Finishing a long rest restores any expended spell slots

(see chapter 8 for the rules on resting).

Som e characters and m onsters have special abilities

that let the m cast spells with out using spell slots.

For

example, amonk who follows the Way ofthe Four

Elements, a warlock who chooses certain eldritch

invocations, and a pit fiend from the Nine Hells can all

cast spells in such a way.

### Castinga Spellata Higher Level

W hen a spellcaster casts a spell using a slot that is of a

higher level than the spell, the spell assum es the higher

level for that casting.

For instance, if Umara casts magic

missile using one of her 2nd-level slots, that magic

missile is 2nd level.

Effectively, the spell expands to fill

the slot it is put into.

Som e spells, such as magic missile and cure wounds,

have m ore powerful effects when cast at a higher level,

as detailed in a spell’s description.

### Cantrips

A cantrip is a spell that can be cast at will, with out

using a spell slot and with out being prepared in

advance.

Repeated practice has fixed the spell in the

caster’s mind and infused the caster with the magic

needed to produce the effect over and over.

A cantrip’s

spell level is 0.

### Rituals

Certain spells have a special tag: ritual.

Such a spell

can be cast following the norm al rules for spellcasting,

or the spell can be cast as a ritual.

The ritual version of

a spell takes 10 minutes longer to cast than normal.

It also doesn’t expend a spell slot, which m eans the

ritual version of a spell can’t be cast at a higher level.

To cast a spell as a ritual, a spellcaster must have a

feature that grants the ability to do so.

The cleric and the

druid, for example, have such a feature.

The caster must

also have the spell prepared or on his or her list of spells

known, unless the character’s ritual feature specifies

otherwise, as the wizard’s does.

Cas tin gaSpell

W hen a character casts any spell, the sam e basic rules

are followed, regardless of the character’s class or the

spell’s effects.

Each spell description in chapter 11 begins with a block

of information, including the spell’s name, level, school

of magic, casting time, range, components, and duration.

The rest of a spell entry describes the spell’s effect.

### Casting Time

Most spells require a single action to cast, but som e

spells require a bonus action, a reaction, or much more

time to cast.

### Bonus Action

A spell cast with a bonus action is especially swift.

You

must use a bonus action on you r turn to cast the spell,

provided that you have n’t already taken a bonus action

this turn.

You can’t cast another spell during the same

turn, except for a cantrip with a casting time of 1 action.

### Reactions

Som e spells can be cast as reactions.

These spells

take a fraction of a second to bring about and are cast

in response to som e event.

If a spell can be cast as a

reaction, the spell description tells you exactly when

you can do so.

Lon ger Cas tin gTim e s

Certain spells (including spells cast as rituals) require

m ore time to cast: minutes or even hours.

W hen you

cast a spell with a casting time longer than a single

action or reaction, you must spend you r action each

turn casting the spell, and you must maintain you r

concentration while you do so (see “Concentration”

below).

If you r concentration is broken, the spell fails,

but you don’t expend a spell slot.

If you want to try

casting the spell again, you must start over.

### Range

The target of a spell must be with in the spell’s range.

For a spell like magic missile, the target is a creature.

For a spell like fireball, the target is the point in space

where the ball of fire erupts.

M ost spells have ranges expressed in feet.

Som e

spells can target only a creature (including you) that you

touch.

Other spells, such as the shield spell, affect only

you.

These spells have a range of self.

Spells that create cones or lines of effect that originate

from you also have a range ofself, indicating that the

origin point of the spell’s effect must be you (see “Areas

ofEffect” later in the this chapter).

Once a spell is cast, its effects aren’t limited by its

range, unless the spell’s description says otherwise.

### Components

A spell’s com ponents are the physical requirements you

must meet in order to cast it.

Each spell’s description

indicates whether it requires verbal (V), som atic (S),

or material (M) com ponents.

If you can’t provide one

or m ore of a spell’s com ponents, you are unable to

cast the spell.

Ver bal (V )

Most spells require the chanting of mystic words.

The

w ords the mselves aren’t the source ofthe spell’s power;

rather, the particular combination of sounds, with

specific pitch and resonance, sets the threads of magic

in motion.

Thus, a character who is gagged or in an area

of silence, such as one created by the silence spell, can’t

cast a spell with a verbal component.

Som ati c (S)

Spellcasting gestures might include a forceful

gesticulation or an intricate set of gestures.

If a spell

requires a som atic component, the caster must have free

use of at least one hand to perform the se gestures.

Mat eri a l (M )

Casting som e spells requires particular objects,

specified in parentheses in the com ponent entry.

A character can use a component pouch or a

spellcasting focus (found in chapter 5) in place of

the com ponents specified for a spell.

But if a cost is

indicated for a component, a character must have that

specific com ponent before he or she can cast the spell.

If a spell states that a material com ponent is

consum ed by the spell, the caster must provide this

com ponent for each casting of the spell.

A spellcaster must have a hand free to access the se

com ponents, but it can be the sam e hand that he or she

uses to perform som atic components.

### Duration

A spell's duration is the length of time the spell persists.

A duration can be expressed in rounds, minutes, hours,

or even years.

Som e spells specify that the ir effects last

until the spells are dispelled or destroyed.

### Instantaneous

Many spells are instantaneous.

The spell harms,

heals, creates, or alters a creature or an object in a way

that can’t be dispelled, because its magic exists only

for an instant.

### Concentration

Som e spells require you to maintain concentration

in order to keep the ir m agic active.

If you lose

concentration, such a spell ends.

If a spell must be maintained with concentration,

that fact appears in its Duration entry, and the spell

specifies how long you can concentrate on it.

You can

end concentration at any time (no action required).

### The Schoolsof Magic

Academies of magic group spells into eight categories called

schools of magic.

Scholars, particularly wizards, apply the se

categories to all spells, believing that all magic functions in

essentially the same way, whether it derives from rigorous

study or is bestowed by a deity.

The schools of magic help describe spells; the y have no

rules of the ir own, although some rules refer to the schools.

Abjuration spells are protective in nature, though some

of the m have aggressive uses.

They create magical barriers,

negate harmful effects, harm trespassers, or banish creatures

to other planes of existence.

Conjuration spells involve the transportation of objects

and creatures from one location to another.

Some spells

summon creatures or objects to the caster’s side, whereas

others allow the caster to teleport to another location.

Some

conjurations create objects or effects out of nothing.

Divination spells reveal information, whether in the form of

secrets long forgotten, glimpses of the future, the locations

of hidden things, the truth behind illusions, or visions of

distant people or places.

Enchantment spells affect the minds of others, influencing

or controlling the ir behavior.

Such spells can make enemies

see the caster as a friend, force creatures to take a course of

action, or even control another creature like a puppet.

Evocation spells manipulate magical energy to produce a

desired effect.

Some call up blasts of fire or lightning.

Others

channel positive energy to heal wounds.

Illusion spells deceive the senses or minds of others.

They

cause people to see things that are not the re, to miss things

that are the re, to hear phantom noises, or to remember

things that never happened.

Some illusions create phantom

images that any creature can see, but the most insidious

illusions plant an image directly in the mind of a creature.

Necromancy spells manipulate the energies of life and

death.

Such spells can grant an extra reserve of life force,

drain the life energy from another creature, create the

undead, or even bring the dead back to life.

Creating the undead through the use of necromancy spells

such as animate dead is not a good act, and only evil casters

use such spells frequently.

Transmutation spells change the properties of a creature,

object, or environment.

They might turn an enemy into a

harmless creature, bolster the strength of an ally, make an

object move at the caster’s command, or enhance a creature’s

innate healing abilities to rapidly recover from injury.

Normal activity, such as moving and attacking, doesn’t

interfere with concentration.

The following factors can

break concentration:

• Casting another spell that requires concentration.

You lose concentration on a spell if you cast another

spell that requires concentration.

You can’t concen­

trate on two spells at once.

• Taking damage.

Whenever you take damage while

you are concentrating on a spell, you must make a

Constitution saving throw to maintain you r concentra­

tion.

The DC equals 10 or half the damage you take,

whichever number is higher.

If you take damage from

multiple sources, such as an arrow and a dragon’s

breath, you make a separate saving throw for each

source of damage.

• Being incapacitated or killed.

You lose concentration

on a spell if you are incapacitated or if you die.

The DM might also decide that certain environmental

phenomena, such as a wave crashing over you while

you’re on a storm -tossed ship, require you to succeed

on a DC 10 Constitution saving throw to maintain

concentration on a spell.

### Targets

A typical spell requires you to pick one or more targets

to be affected by the spell’s magic.

A spell's description

tells you whether the spell targets creatures, objects, or

a point of origin for an area of effect (described below).

Unless a spell has a perceptible effect, a creature

might not know it w as targeted by a spell at all.

An effect

like crackling lightning is obvious, but amore subtle

effect, such as an attempt to read a creature’s thoughts,

typically goes unnoticed, unless a spell says otherwise.

ACl ear Pa tht oth eTa rge t

To target something, you must have a clear path to it,

so it can’t be behind total cover.

If you place an area of effect at a point that you can’t

see and an obstruction, such as a wall, is between you

and that point, the point oforigin com es into being on

the near side of that obstruction.

### Targeting Yourself

If a spell targets a creature of you r choice, you can

choose you rself, unless the creature must be hostile or

specifically a creature other than you.

If you are in the

area of effect of a spell you cast, you can target you rself.

### Areasof Effect

Spells such as burning hands and cone of cold cover an

area, allowing the m to affect multiple creatures at once.

A spell’s description specifies its area of effect,

which typically has one of five different shapes: cone,

cube, cylinder, line, or sphere.

Every area of effect has

a point of origin, a location from which the spell’s

energy erupts.

The rules for each shape specify how you

position its point of origin.

Typically,

a point of origin is a point in space, but

som e spells have an area w hose origin is a

creature or an object.

A spell’s effect expands in straight lines from the point

of origin.

If no unblocked straight line extends from the

point of origin to a location with in the area of effect, that

location isn’t included in the spell’s area.

To block one of

the se imaginary lines, an obstruction must provide total

cover, as explained in chapter 9.

### Cone

A cone extends in a direction you choose from its point

of origin.

A cone’s width at a given point along its length

is equal to that point’s distance from the point of origin.

A cone’s area of effect specifies its maximum length.

A cone’s point of origin is not included in the cone’s

area of effect, unless you decide otherwise.

### Cube

You select a cube’s point of origin, which lies anywhere

on a face of the cubic effect.

The cube’s size is expressed

as the length of each side.

A cube’s point of origin is not included in the cube’s

area of effect, unless you decide otherwise.

### Cylinder

A cylinder’s point of origin is the center of a circle of a

particular radius, as given in the spell description.

The

circle must either be on the ground or at the height of

the spell effect.

The energy in a cylinder expands in

straight lines from the point of origin to the perimeter of

the circle, forming the base of the cylinder.

The spell’s

effect the n shoots up from the base or down from the

top, to a distance equal to the height of the cylinder.

A cylinder’s point of origin is included in the cylinder’s

area of effect.

L in e

A line extends from its point of origin in a straight path

up to its length and covers an area defined by its width.

A line’s point of origin is not included in the line’s area

of effect, unless you decide otherwise.

### Sphere

You select a sphere’s point of origin, and the sphere

extends outward from that point.

The sphere’s

size is expressed as a radius in feet that extends

from the point.

A sphere’s point of origin is included in the sphere’s

area of effect.

### Saving Throws

Many spells specify that a target can make a saving

throw to avoid som e or all of a spell’s effects.

The spell

specifies the ability that the target uses for the save and

what happens on a success or failure.

The DC to resist one of you r spells equals 8 + you r

spellcasting ability modifier + you r proficiency bonus +

any special modifiers.

### Attack Rolls

Som e spells require the caster to make an attack roll

to determine whether the spell effect hits the intended

target.

Your attack bonus with a spell attack equals you r

spellcasting ability m odifier + you r proficiency bonus.

Most spells that require attack rolls involve ranged

attacks.

Rem ember that you have disadvantage on a

ranged attack roll if you are with in 5 feet of a hostile

creature that can see you and that isn’t incapacitated

(see chapter 9).

### Combining Magical Effects

The effects of different spells add together while

the durations of those spells overlap.

The effects of

the same spell cast multiple times don't combine,

however.

Instead, the m ost potent effect—such as the

highest bonus—from those castings applies while the ir

durations overlap.

For example, if two clerics cast bless on the same

target, that character gains the spell’s benefit only

once; he or she doesn’t get to roll two bonus dice.

The Wea veo fMa g ic

The worlds with in the D&D multiverse are magical places.

All existence is suffused with magical power, and potential

energy lies untapped in every rock, stream, and living

creature, and even in the air itself.

Raw magic is the stuff of

creation, the mute and mindless will of existence, permeating

every bit of matter and present in every manifestation of

energy throughout the multiverse.

Mortals can’t directly shape this raw magic.

Instead, the y

make use of a fabric of magic, a kind of interface between

the will of a spellcaster and the stuff of raw magic.

The

spellcasters of the Forgotten Realms call it the Weave and

recognize its essence as the goddess Mystra, but casters

have varied ways of naming and visualizing this interface.

By

any name, with out the Weave, raw magic is locked away and

inaccessible;the most powerful archmage can't light a candle

with magic in an area where the Weave has been torn.

But

surrounded by the Weave, a spellcaster can shape lightning

to blast foes, transport hundreds of miles in the blink of an

eye, or even reverse death itself.

All magic depends on the Weave, though different kinds

of magic access it in a variety of ways.

The spells of wizards,

warlocks, sorcerers, and bards are commonly called arcane

magic.

These spells rely on an understanding— learned or

intuitive— of the workings of the Weave.

The caster plucks

directly at the strands of the Weave to create the desired

effect.

Eldritch knights and arcane tricksters also use arcane

magic.

The spells of clerics, druids, paladins, and rangers are

called divine magic.

These spellcasters’ access to the Weave

is mediated by divine power— gods, the divine forces of

nature, or the sacred weight of a paladin’s oath.

Whenever a magic effect is created, the threads of the

Weave intertwine, twist, and fold to make the effect possible.

When characters use divination spells such as detect magic or

identify, the y glimpse the Weave.

A spell such as dispel magic

smooths the Weave.

Spells such as antimagic field rearrange

the Weave so that magic flows around, rather than through,

the area affected by the spell.

And in places where the Weave

is damaged or torn, magic works in unpredictable ways— or

not at all.

8 th-level abjuration

Casting Time: 1 action

Range: Self (10-foot-radius sphere)

Components: V, S, M (a pinch of powdered iron or

A 10-foot-radius invisible sphere of antimagic surrounds

you.

This area is divorced from the magical energy that

suffuses the multiverse.

Within the sphere, spells can’t

be cast, sum m oned creatures disappear, and even m agic

items becom e mundane.

Until the spell ends, the sphere

m oves with you, centered on you.

Spells and other magical effects, except those created

by an artifact or a deity, are suppressed in the sphere

and can’t protrude into it.

A slot expended to cast

a suppressed spell is consum ed.

W hile an effect is

suppressed, it doesn’t function, but the time it spends

suppressed counts against its duration.

Targeted Effects.

Spells and other magical effects,

such as magic missile and charm person, that target

a creature or an object in the sphere have no effect

on that target.

Areas of Magic.

The area of another spell or magical

effect, such as fireball, can’t extend into the sphere.

If the sphere overlaps an area of magic, the part of

the area that is covered by the sphere is suppressed.

For example, the flames created by a wall offire are

suppressed with in the sphere, creating a gap in the wall

if the overlap is large enough.

Spells.

Any active spell or other magical effect on a

creature or an object in the sphere is suppressed while

the creature or object is in it.

Magic Items.

The properties and powers of

m agic items are suppressed in the sphere.

For

example, a +1 longsword in the sphere functions as a

nonm agical longsword.

Amagic w eapon’s properties and powers are

suppressed if it is used against a target in the sphere or

wielded by an attacker in the sphere.

If a magic weapon

or a piece of magic ammunition fully leaves the sphere

(for example, if you fire amagic arrow or throw a magic

spear at a target outside the sphere), the m agic of the

item ceases to be suppressed as soon as it exits.

Magical Travel.

Teleportation and planar travel

fail to work in the sphere, whether the sphere is the

destination or the departure point for such magical

travel.

A portal to another location, world, or plane of

existence, as well as an opening to an extradimensional

space such as that created by the rope trick spell,

temporarily closes while in the sphere.

Creatures and Objects.

A creature or object

sum m oned or created by m agic temporarily winks out

of existence in the sphere.

Such a creature instantly

reappears once the space the creature occupied is no

longer with in the sphere.

Dispel Magic.

Spells and magical effects such as

dispel magic have no effect on the sphere.

Likewise, the

spheres created by different antimagic field spells don’t

nullify each other.

creature, such as red dragons, goblins, or vampires.

You invest the target with an aura that either attracts or

repels the specified creatures for the duration.

Choose

antipathy or sympathy as the aura’s effect.

Antipathy.

The enchantment causes creatures of the

kind you designated to feel an intense urge to leave the

area and avoid the target.

W hen such a creature can

see the target or com es with in 60 feet of it, the creature

must succeed on aWisdom saving throw or becom e

frightened.

The creature remains frightened while it can

see the target or is with in 60 feet of it.

W hile frightened

by the target, the creature must use its movement to

move to the nearest safe spot from which it can’t see

the target.

If the creature m oves m ore than 60 feet from

the target and can’t see it, the creature is no longer

frightened, but the creature becom es frightened again if

it regains sight of the target or m oves with in 60 feet ofit.

Sympathy.

The enchantment causes the specified

creatures to feel an intense urge to approach the target

while with in 60 feet ofit or able to see it.

the creature must succeed on aWisdom saving throw or

use its movement on each ofits turns to enter the area

or move with in reach of the target.

W hen the creature

has done so, it can’t will ingly move away from the target.

If the target dam ages or otherwise harms an affected

creature, the affected creature can make aWisdom

saving throw to end the effect, as described below.

Ending the Effect.

If an affected creature ends its

turn while not with in 60 feet of the target or able to see

it, the creature makes aWisdom saving throw.

On a

successful save, the creature is no longer affected by

the target and recognizes the feeling ofrepugnance or

attraction as magical.

In addition, a creature affected by

the spell is allowed another W isdom saving throw every

24 hours while the spell persists.

A creature that successfully saves against this effect

is immune to it for 1 minute, after which time it can be

affected again.

hovers in the air for the duration.

You mentally receive visual information from the eye,

which has normal vision and darkvision out to 30 feet.

The eye can look in every direction.

As an action, you can move the eye up to 30 feet in

any direction.

There is no limit to how far away from

in diameter, opens over each point.

If the portal would

open in the space occupied by a creature, the spell fails,

and the casting is lost.

The portals are two-dimensional glowing rings

filled with mist, hovering inches from the ground and

perpendicular to it at the points you choose.

A ring is

visible only from one side (you r choice), which is the side

that functions as a portal.

Any creature or object entering the portal exits from

the other portal as if the two were adjacent to each

other; passing through a portal from the nonportal side

has no effect.

The mist that fills each portal is opaque

and blocks vision through it.

On you r turn, you can

rotate the rings as a bonus action so that the active side

faces in a different direction.

### Arcane Lock

gp and one ornately carved bar of silver worth

at least 100 gp, all of which the spell consum es)

Duration: Special

You and up to eight will ing creatures with in range

project you r astral bodies into the Astral Plane (the

spell fails and the casting is wasted if you are already

on that plane).

The material body you leave behind is

unconscious and in a state of suspended animation; it

doesn’t need food or air and doesn’t age.

Your astral body resem bles you r m ortal form in

almost every way, replicating you r game statistics and

possessions.

The principal difference is the addition of

a silvery cord that extends from between you r shoulder

blades and trails behind you, fading to invisibility after

1 foot.

This cord is you r tether to you r material body.

As

long as the tether remains intact, you can find you r way

home.

If the cord is cut—som ething that can happen

only when an effect specifically states that it does—you r

soul and body are separated, killing you instantly.

Your astral form can freely travel through the Astral

Plane and can pass through portals the re leading to any

other plane.

If you enter a new plane or return to the

plane you were on when casting this spell, you r body and

possessions are transported along the silver cord, allowing

you to re-enter you r body as you enter the new plane.

Your astral form is a separate incarnation.

Any damage

or other effects that apply to it have no effect on you r

physical body, nor do the y persist when you return to it.

The spell ends for you and you r com panions when

you use you r action to dismiss it.

W hen the spell ends,

the affected creature returns to its physical body,

and it awakens.

The spell might also end early for you or one ofyour

com panions.

A successful dispel magic spell used

against an astral or physical body ends the spell for that

creature.

If a creature’s original body or its astral form

drops to 0 hit points, the spell ends for that creature.

If

the spell ends and the silver cord is intact, the cord pulls

the creature’s astral form back to its body, ending its

state of suspended animation.

If you are returned to you r body prematurely, you r

com panions remain in the ir astral form s and must find

the ir own way back to the ir bodies, usually by dropping

to 0 hit points.

on any one creature that you can see with in 30 feet of

If the creature you choose has an Intelligence of

3 or lower or doesn’t speak any language, the creature

is unaffected.

You initially learn the surface thoughts of the

creature—what is most on its mind in that moment.

As

an action, you can either shift you r attention to another

creature’s thoughts or attempt to probe deeper into the

sam e creature’s mind.

If you probe deeper, the target

must make aWisdom saving throw.

If it fails, you gain

insight into its reasoning (if any), its emotional state,

and som ething that loom s large in its mind (such as

som ething it w orries over, loves, or hates).

If it succeeds,

the spell ends.

Either way, the target knows that you are

probing into its mind, and unless you shift you r attention

to another creature’s thoughts, the creature can use

its action on its turn to make an Intelligence check

contested by you r Intelligence check; if it succeeds,

the spell ends.

Questions verbally directed at the target creature

naturally shape the course of its thoughts, so this spell

is particularly effective as part of an interrogation.

You can also use this spell to detect the presence of

thinking creatures you can’t see.

W hen you cast the

spell or as you r action during the duration, you can

search for thoughts with in 30 feet of you.

penetrate barriers, but 2 feet of rock, 2 inches ofany

metal other than lead, or a thin sheet of lead blocks you.

You can’t detect a creature with an Intelligence of 3 or

lower or one that doesn’t speak any language.

Once you detect the presence of a creature in this way,

you can read its thoughts for the rest of the duration as

described above, even if you can’t see it, but it must still

be with in range.

to dism iss it.

You can seem 1 foot shorter or taller and

You can’t change

you r body type, so you must adopt a form that has the

sam e basic arrangement of limbs.

Otherwise, the extent

of the illusion is up to you.

The changes wrought by this spell fail to hold up to

physical inspection.

For example, if you use this spell

to add a hat to you r outfit, objects pass through the hat,

and anyone w ho touches it w ould feel nothing or would

feel you r head and hair.

If you use this spell to appear

thinner than you are, the hand of som eone who reaches

out to touch you would bump into you while it was

from the object’s mouth.

W hen you cast this spell, you

can have the spell end after it delivers its message, or

troglodyte’s stench).

As long as you are with in range of the illusion, you

can use you r action to cause the image to move to

any other spot with in range.

As the image changes

location, you can alter its appearance so that its

movements appear natural for the image.

For example,

if you create an im age of a creature and move it, you

can alter the image so that it appears to be walking.

Similarly, you can cause the illusion to make different

sounds at different times, even making it carry on a

conversation, for example.

Physical interaction with the image reveals it to be an

illusion, because things can pass through it.

A creature

that uses its action to examine the image can determine

that it is an illusion with a successful Intelligence

(Investigation) check against you r spell save DC.

If a

creature discerns the illusion for what it is, the creature

can see through the image, and its other sensory

damage and 20d6 bludgeoning damage on a failed

save, or half as much damage on a successful one.

A

creature in the area of m ore than one fiery burst is

affected only once.

The spell dam ages objects in the area and ignites

flammable objects that aren’t being worn or carried.

### Mind Blank

8 th-level abjuration

Casting Time: 1 action

Range: Touch

Components: V, S

Duration: 24 hours

Until the spell ends, one will ing creature you touch is

immune to psychic damage, any effect that would sense

its em otions or read its thoughts, divination spells, and

the charm ed condition.

The spell even foils wish spells

and spells or effects of similar power used to affect the

target’s mind or to gain information about the target.

### Minor Illusion

Illusion cantrip

Casting Time: 1 action

Range: 30 feet

Components: S, M (a bit of fleece)

Duration: 1 minute

You create a sound or an image of an object with in

range that lasts for the duration.

The illusion also ends if

you dismiss it as an action or cast this spell again.

If you create a sound, its volume can range from a

whisper to a scream .

It can be you r voice, som eone

else’s voice, a lion’s roar, a beating of drums, or any

other sound you choose.

The sound continues unabated

throughout the duration, or you can make discrete

sounds at different times before the spell ends.

If you create an image of an object—such as a chair,

muddy footprints, or a small chest—it must be no larger

than a 5-foot cube.

The image can’t create sound, light,

smell, or any other sensory effect.

Physical interaction

with the image reveals it to be an illusion, because

things can pass through it.

If a creature uses its action to examine the sound or

image, the creature can determine that it is an illusion

with a successful Intelligence (Investigation) check

against you r spell save DC.

If a creature discerns the

illusion for what it is, the illusion becom es faint to

the creature.

### Mirage Arcane

7th-level illusion

Casting Time: 10 minutes

Range: Sight

Components: V, S

Duration: 10 days

You make terrain in an area up to 1 mile square

look, sound, smell, and even feel like som e other sort

of terrain.

The terrain’s general shape remains the

same, however.

Open fields or a road could be made to

resem ble a swamp, hill, crevasse, or som e other difficult

or im passable terrain.

A pond can be made to seem like

a grassy meadow, a precipice like a gentle slope, or a

rock-strewn gully like a wide and sm ooth road.

Similarly, you can alter the appearance of structures,

or add the m where none are present.

The spell doesn’t

disguise, conceal, or add creatures.

The illusion includes audible, visual, tactile, and

olfactory elements, so it can turn clear ground into

difficult terrain (or vice versa) or otherwise impede

movement through the area.

Any piece of the illusory

terrain (such as a rock or stick) that is removed from the

spell’s area disappears immediately.

Creatures with truesight can see through the illusion

to the terrain’s true form; however, all other elements

of the illusion remain, so while the creature is aware of

the illusion’s presence, the creature can still physically

interact with the illusion.

### Mirror Image

2nd-level illusion

Casting Time: 1 action

Range: Self

Components: V, S

Duration: 1 minute

Three illusory duplicates of you rself appear in you r

space.

Until the spell ends, the duplicates move with

you and m im ic you r actions, shifting position so it’s

im possible to track which image is real.

You can use

you r action to dismiss the illusory duplicates.

Each time a creature targets you with an attack during

the spell’s duration, roll a d20 to determine whether the

attack instead targets one of you r duplicates.

If you have three duplicates, you must roll a 6 or

higher to change the attack’s target to a duplicate.

With

two duplicates, you must roll an 8 or higher.

With one

duplicate, you must roll an 11 or higher.

A duplicate’s AC equals 10 + you r Dexterity modifier.

If an attack hits a duplicate, the duplicate is destroyed.

A

duplicate can be destroyed only by an attack that hits it.

It ignores all other damage and effects.

The spell ends

when all three duplicates are destroyed.

A creature is unaffected by this spell if it can’t see, if it

relies on senses other than sight, such as blindsight, or

if it can perceive illusions as false, as with truesight.

### Mislead

5th-level illusion

Casting Time: 1 action

Range: Self

Components: S

Duration: Concentration, up to 1 hour

You becom e invisible at the same time that an illusory

double of you appears where you are standing.

The

double lasts for the duration, but the invisibility ends if

you attack or cast a spell.

You can use you r action to move you r illusory double

up to twice you r speed and make it gesture, speak, and

behave in what ever way you choose.

You can see through its eyes and hear through its ears

as if you w ere located where it is.

On each of you r turns

as a bonus action, you can switch from using its senses

to using you r own, or back again.

W hile you are using its

senses, you are blinded and deafened in regard to you r

own surroundings.

Mis tySt e p

2nd-level conjuration

Casting Time: 1 bonus action

Range: Self

Components: V

Duration: Instantaneous

Briefly surrounded by silvery mist, you teleport up to 30

feet to an unoccupied space that you can see.

### Modify Memory

5th-level enchantment

Casting Time: 1 action

Range: 30 feet

Components: V, S

Duration: Concentration, up to 1 minute

You attempt to reshape another creature’smem ories.

One creature that you can see must make aWisdom

saving throw.

If you are fighting the creature, it has

advantage on the saving throw.

On a failed save, the

target becom es charm ed by you for the duration.

The

charm ed target is incapacitated and unaware of its

surroundings, though it can still hear you.

If it takes any

damage or is targeted by another spell, this spell ends,

and none of the target’smem ories are modified.

W hile this charm lasts, you can affect the target’s

m em ory of an event that it experienced with in the last

24 hours and that lasted no m ore than 10 minutes.

You

can permanently eliminate all m em ory of the event,

allow the target to recall the event with perfect clarity

and exacting detail, change its m em ory of the details of

the event, or create amem ory of som e other event.

You must speak to the target to describe how

its m em ories are affected, and it must be able to

understand you r language for the modified m em ories to

take root.

Its mind fills in any gaps in the details of you r

description.

If the spell ends before you have finished

describing the modified m em ories, the creature’s

m em ory isn’t altered.

Otherwise, the modified m em ories

take hold when the spell ends.

Amodified m em ory doesn’t necessarily affect how a

creature behaves, particularly if the m em ory contradicts

the creature’s natural inclinations, alignment, or beliefs.

An illogical modified memory, such as implanting a

m em ory of how much the creature enjoyed dousing

itself in acid, is dism issed, perhaps as a bad dream.

The

DM might deem a modified m em ory too nonsensical to

affect a creature in a significant manner.

A remove curse or greater restoration spell cast on the

target restores the creature’s true memory.

AtHigher Levels.

If you cast this spell using a spell

slot of 6th level or higher, you can alter the target’s

m em ories of an event that took place up to 7 days ago

(6th level), 30 days ago (7th level), 1 year ago (8th level),

or any time in the creature’s past (9th level).

W hen a creature enters the spell’s area for the first

time on a turn or starts its turn the re, it is engulfed

in ghostly flames that cause searing pain, and it must

make a Constitution saving throw.

It takes 2d10 radiant

damage on a failed save, or half as much damage on a

successful one.

A shapechanger makes its saving throw with

disadvantage.

If it fails, it also instantly reverts to its

original form and can’t assume a different form until it

leaves the spell’s light.

On each of you r turns after you cast this spell, you can

use an action to move the beam 60 feet in any direction.

At Higher Levels.

W hen you cast this spell using a

spell slot of 3rd level or higher, the damage increases by

The

area is a cube that can be as small as 5 feet to as large

as 100 feet on each side.

The spell lasts for the duration

or until you use an action to dism iss it.

W hen you cast the spell, you decide what sort of

security the spell provides, choosing any or all of the

following properties:

• Sound can't pass through the barrier at the edge of

the warded area.

• The barrier of the warded area appears dark and foggy,

preventing vision (including darkvision) through it.

• Sensors created by divination spells can’t appear

inside the protected area or pass through the barrier

at its perimeter.

• Creatures in the area can’t be targeted by divination

spells.

• Nothing can teleport into or out of the warded area.

• Planar travel is blocked with in the warded area.

Casting this spell on the same spot every day for a

year makes this effect permanent.

AtHigher Levels.

W hen you cast this spell using a

spell slot of 5th level or higher, you can increase the size

of the cube by 100 feet for each slot level beyond 4th.

Thus you could protect a cube that can be up to 200 feet

on one side by using a spell slot of 5th level.

can’t leave it.

Furnishings and other objects created

by this spell dissipate into sm oke if removed from the

to 20 feet deep, and so on.

It takes 10 minutes for the se

changes to complete.

At the end ofevery 10 minutes you spend

creatures in the area can’t usually be trapped or injured

by the ground’s movement.

This spell can’t manipulate natural stone or

stone construction.

Rocks and structures shift to

accom m odate the new terrain.

If the way you shape

growth.

The moved earth carries any plants along with it.

mistletoe and a sprig of spruce)

Duration: Concentration, up to 1 hour

A veil of shadows and silence radiates from you,

masking you and you r com panions from detection.

Components: V, S, M (a pinch ofsesam e seeds)

Duration: 1 hour

A passage appears at a point of you r choice that you

can see on awooden, plaster, or stone surface (such as

a wall, a ceiling, or a floor) with in range, and lasts for

### Phantasmal Force

2nd-level illusion

Casting Time: 1 action

Range: 60 feet

Components: V, S, M (a bit of fleece)

Duration: Concentration, up to 1 minute

You craft an illusion that takes root in the mind of a

creature that you can see with in range.

The target must

make an Intelligence saving throw.

On a failed save, you

create a phantasmal object, creature, or other visible

phenom enon of you r choice that is no larger than a

10-foot cube and that is perceivable only to the target

for the duration.

This spell has no effect on undead

or constructs.

The phantasm includes sound, temperature, and other

stimuli, also evident only to the creature.

The target can use its action to examine the phantasm

with an Intelligence (Investigation) check against you r

spell save DC.

If the check succeeds, the target realizes

that the phantasm is an illusion, and the spell ends.

W hile a target is affected by the spell, the target treats

the phantasm as if it were real.

The target rationalizes

any illogical outcom es from interacting with the

phantasm.

For example, a target attempting to walk

across a phantasmal bridge that spans a chasm falls

once it steps onto the bridge.

If the target survives the

fall, it still believes that the bridge exists and com es up

with som e other explanation for its fall—it w as pushed,

it slipped, or a strong wind might have knocked it off.

An affected target is so convinced of the phantasm’s

reality that it can even take damage from the illusion.

A

phantasm created to appear as a creature can attack the

target.

Similarly, a phantasm created to appear as fire, a

pool of acid, or lava can burn the target.

Each round on

you r turn, the phantasm can deal 1d6 psychic damage

to the target if it is in the phantasm’s area or with in 5

feet of the phantasm, provided that the illusion is of a

creature or hazard that could logically deal damage,

such as by attacking.

The target perceives the damage

as a type appropriate to the illusion.

On a failed save,

the target becom es frightened for the duration.

At the

start of each ofthe target’s turns before the spell ends,

the target must succeed on aWisdom saving throw

or take 4 d10 psychic damage.

On a successful save,

the spell ends.

AtHigher Levels.

W hen you cast this spell using a

Pha nto m St eed

Casting Time: 1 minute

Range: 30 feet

Components: V, S

Duration: 1 hour

A Large quasi-real, horselike creature appears on

the ground in an unoccupied space ofyour choice

with in range.

You decide the creature’s appearance,

but it is equipped with a saddle, bit, and bridle.

Any

of the equipment created by the spell vanishes in a

puff of sm oke if it is carried m ore than 10 feet away

from the steed.

For the duration, you or a creature you choose can

ride the steed.

The creature uses the statistics for a

riding horse, except it has a speed of 100 feet and can

travel 10 miles in an hour, or 13 m iles at a fast pace.

W hen the spell ends, the steed gradually fades, giving

the rider 1 minute to dismount.

The spell ends if you use

an action to dism iss it or if the steed takes any damage.

### Planar Ally

6th-level conjuration

Casting Time: 10 minutes

Range: 60 feet

Components: V, S

Duration: Instantaneous

You beseech an otherworldly entity for aid.

The being

must be known to you: a god, a primordial, a demon

prince, or som e other being of cosm ic power.

That entity

sends a celestial, an elemental, or a fiend loyal to it to

aid you, making the creature appear in an unoccupied

space with in range.

If you know a specific creature’s

name, you can speak that name when you cast this spell

to request that creature, though you might get a different

creature anyway (DM ’s choice).

W hen the creature appears, it is under no com pulsion

to behave in any particular way.

You can ask the

creature to perform a service in exchange for payment,

but it isn’t obliged to do so.

The requested task could

range from simple (fly us across the chasm, or help us

fight a battle) to com plex (spy on our enemies, or protect

us during our foray into the dungeon).

You must be

able to com m unicate with the creature to bargain for

its services.

Payment can take a variety of forms.

A celestial might

require a sizable donation of gold or m agic items to

an allied temple, while a fiend might demand a living

sacrifice or a gift of treasure.

Som e creatures might

exchange the ir service for a quest undertaken by you.

As a rule of thumb, a task that can be m easured in

minutes requires a payment worth 100 gp per minute.

A

task m easured in hours requires 1,000 gp per hour.

And

a task m easured in days (up to 10 days) requires 10,000

gp per day.

The DM can adjust the se payments based on

the circum stances under which you cast the spell.

If the

task is aligned with the creature’s ethos, the payment

might be halved or even waived.

Nonhazardous tasks

typically require only half the suggested payment, while

especially dangerous tasks might require a greater gift.

Creatures rarely accept tasks that seem suicidal.

After the creature com pletes the task, or when the

agreed-upon duration of service expires, the creature

returns to its home plane after reporting back to you,

if appropriate to the task and if possible.

If you are

unable to agree on a price for the creature’s service, the

creature immediately returns to its hom e plane.

A creature enlisted to join you r group counts as

amem ber of it, receiving a full share of experience

points awarded.

### Planar Binding

Duration: 24 hours

With this spell, you attempt to bind a celestial, an

elemental, a fey, or a fiend to you r service.

The creature

must be with in range for the entire casting of the spell.

of an inverted magic circle in order to keep it trapped

while this spell is cast.) At the com pletion of the casting,

the target must make a Charisma saving throw.

On a

unless you use you r action to dism iss it sooner.

The changes wrought by this spell fail to hold up to

physical inspection.

For example, if you use this spell

to add a hat to a creature’s outfit, objects pass through

the hat, and anyone who touches it would feel nothing

or w ould feel the creature’s head and hair.

If you use

this spell to appear thinner than you are, the hand of

som eone w ho reaches out to touch you would bump into

you while it was seem ingly still in midair.

transform into an average example ofthat creature, one

with out any class levels or the Spellcasting trait.

of the chosen creature, though you retain you r

alignment and Intelligence, W isdom , and Charisma

scores.

You also retain all of you r skill and saving

throw proficiencies, in addition to gaining those of the

creature.

If the creature has the sam e proficiency as you

and the bonus listed in its statistics is higher than you rs,

use the creature’s bonus in place of you rs.

You can’t use

any legendary actions or lair actions of the new form.

You assume the hit points and Hit Dice of the new

form.

When you revert to you r normal form, you

return to the number ofhit points you had before you

normal form.

reduce you r normal form to 0 hit points, you aren’t

knocked unconscious.

race, or other source and can use the m, provided that

you r new form is physically capable of doing so.

You can only speak if the creature can normally speak.

W hen you transform, you choose whether you r

equipment falls to the ground, merges into the new

form, or is worn by it.

W orn equipment functions as

normal.

The DM determines whether it is practical for

the new form to w ear a piece of equipment, based on

the creature’s shape and size.

Your equipment doesn’t

change shape or size to match the new form, and any

equipment that the new form can’twear must either fall

to the ground or merge into you r new form.

Equipment

that merges has no effect in that state.

During this spell’s duration, you can use you r action to

assume a different form following the same restrictions

and rules for the original form, with one exception: if

you r new form has more hit points than you r current

one, you r hit points remain at the ir current value.

illusion, because things can pass through it.

A creature

worth 100 gp per hit point it regains.

The simulacrum

activated only under certain circum stances or according

to a creature’s physical characteristics (such as height

or weight), or physical kind (for example, the ward could

You can also

specify creatures that don’t trigger the glyph, such as

those who say a certain password.

options below for its effect.

Familiarity. “Permanent circle” means a permanent

teleportation circle w hose sigil sequence you know.

“Associated object” means that you possess an object

taken from the desired destination with in the last six

months, such as a book from a wizard’s library, bed

linen from a royal suite, or a chunk of marble from a

lich’s secret tomb.

“Very familiar” is a place you have been very often, a

place you have carefully studied, or a place you can see

when you cast the spell. “Seen casually” is som eplace

you have seen m ore than once but with which you aren’t

very familiar. “Viewed once” is a place you have seen

once, possibly using magic. “Description” is a place

w hose location and appearance you know through

som eone else’s description, perhaps from a map.

“False destination” is a place that doesn’t exist.

Perhaps you tried to scry an enemy’s sanctum but

instead viewed an illusion, or you are attempting to

teleport to a familiar location that no longer exists.

On Target.

You and you r group (or the target object)

appear where you want to.

O ff Target.

You and you r group (or the target object)

appear a random distance away from the destination

in a random direction.

Distance off target is 1d10 x

1d10 percent of the distance that was to be traveled.

For example, if you tried to travel 120 miles, landed off

target, and rolled a 5 and 3 on the two d 10s, the n you

would be off target by 15 percent, or 18 miles.

The DM

determines the direction off target randomly by rolling a

d8 and designating 1 as north, 2 as northeast, 3 as east,

and so on around the points of the com pass.

If you were

teleporting to a coastal city and w ound up 18 m iles out

at sea, you could be in trouble.

Similar Area.

You and you r group (or the target

object) wind up in a different area that’s visually or

the matically similar to the target area.

If you are

heading for you r hom e laboratory, for example, you

might wind up in another w izard’s laboratory or in

an alchemical supply shop that has many of the same

tools and implements as you r laboratory.

Generally,

you appear in the closest similar place, but since the

spell has no range limit, you could conceivably wind up

anywhere on the plane.

Mishap.

The spell’s unpredictable magic results in a

difficult journey.

Each teleporting creature (or the target

object) takes 3d10 force damage, and the DM rerolls on

the table to see where you wind up (multiple mishaps

can occur, dealing damage each time).

Tel epo rta tio nCir cle

portal opens with in the circle you drew and remains

open until the end of you r next turn.

Any creature that

enters the portal instantly appears with in 5 feet of the

that space is occupied.

Many major temples, guilds, and other important

places have permanent teleportation circles inscribed

Each such circle

runes arranged in a particular pattern.

W hen you first

determined by the DM.

You can learn additional sigil

sequences during you r adventures.

a new sigil sequence to m em ory after studying it

You can create a permanent teleportation circle by

slopes and the like, but it can’t cross an elevation change

For example, the disk can’t move

across a 10-foot-deep pit, nor could it leave such a pit if it

Wal lof St one

5th-level evocation

Casting Time: 1 action

Range: 120 feet

Components: V, S, M (a small block of granite)

at a point you choose with in range.

If the wall cuts through a creature’s space when it

appears, the creature is pushed to one side of the wall

(you r choice).

If a creature w ould be surrounded on all

sides by the wall (or the wall and another solid surface),

that creature can make a Dexterity saving throw.

On a

that it is no longer enclosed by the wall.

The wall can have any shape you desire, though it

can’t occupy the same space as a creature or object.

The wall doesn’t need to be vertical or rest on any firm

foundation.

It must, however, merge with and be solidly

supported by existing stone.

must halve the size of each panel to create supports.

You can crudely shape the wall to create crenellations,

battlements, and so on.

The wall is an object made of stone that can be

damaged and thus breached.

### Wish

9th-level conjuration

Casting Time: 1 action

Range: Self

Components: V

Duration: Instantaneous

Wish is the mightiest spell a mortal creature can

cast.

By simply speaking aloud, you can alter the very

foundations of reality in accord with you r desires.

The basic use of this spell is to duplicate any other

spell of 8th level or lower.

You don’t need to meet any

requirements in that spell, including costly components.

The spell simply takes effect.

Alternatively, you can create one of the following

effects of you r choice:

• You create one object of up to 25,000 gp in value that

isn’tam agic item.

The object can be no m ore than

300 feet in any dimension, and it appears in an unoc­

cupied space you can see on the ground.

• You allow up to twenty creatures that you can see to

regain all hit points, and you end all effects on the m

described in the greater restoration spell.

• You grant up to ten creatures that you can see resis­

tance to a damage type you choose.

• You grant up to ten creatures you can see immunity to

a single spell or other magical effect for 8 hours.

For

instance, you could make you rself and all you r com ­

panions immune to a lich’s life drain attack.

• You undo a single recent event by forcing a reroll of

any roll made with in the last round (including you r

last turn).

Reality reshapes itself to accom m odate the

new result.

For example, a wish spell could undo an

opponent’s successful save, a foe’s critical hit, or a

friend’s failed save.

You can force the reroll to be made

with advantage or disadvantage, and you can choose

whether to use the reroll or the original roll.

You might be able to achieve som ething beyond the

scope ofthe above examples.

State you r wish to the DM

as precisely as possible.

The DM has great latitude in

ruling what occurs in such an instance; the greater the

wish, the greater the likelihood that som ething goes

wrong.

This spell might simply fail, the effect you desire

might only be partly achieved, or you might suffer som e

unforeseen consequence as a result of how you worded

the wish.

For example, wishing that a villain w ere dead

might propel you forward in time to a period when that

villain is no longer alive, effectively removing you from

the game.

Similarly, wishing for a legendary magic item

or artifact might instantly transport you to the presence

of the item’s current owner.

The stress of casting this spell to produce any effect

other than duplicating another spell w eakens you.

After

enduring that stress, each time you cast a spell until

you finish a long rest, you take 1d10 necrotic damage

per level of that spell.

This damage can’t be reduced or

prevented in any way.

In addition, you r Strength drops

to 3, if it isn’t 3 or lower already, for 2d4 days.

For each

of those days that you spend resting and doing nothing

m ore than light activity, you r remaining recovery time

decreases by 2 days.

Finally, the re is a 33 percent

chance that you are unable to cast wish ever again if you

suffer this stress.

for the duration, you can use you r action to deal 1d12

lightning damage to the target automatically.

The spell

ends if you use you r action to do anything else.

The spell

also ends if the target is ever outside the spell’s range or

if it has total cover from you.

a spell slot of 2nd level or higher, the initial damage

cast this spell with out first preparing a sanctuary, the

spell has no effect.

You must designate a sanctuary by casting this spell

with in a location, such as a temple, dedicated to or

strongly linked to you r deity.

spell in this manner in an area that isn’t dedicated to

you r deity, the spell has no effect.

throw.

On a failed save, a creature can’t speak a

deliberate lie while in the radius.

each creature succeeds or fails on its saving throw.

Exh aus t io n

Some special abilities and environmental hazards, such as

starvation and the long-term effects of freezing or scorching

temperatures, can lead to a special condition called

exhaustion.

Exhaustion is measured in six levels.

An effect

can give a creature one or more levels of exhaustion, as

specified in the effect’s description.

Level

Effect

1

Disadvantage on ability checks

2

Speed halved

3

Disadvantage on attack rolls and saving throws

4

Hit point maximum halved

5

Speed reduced to 0

6

Death

If an already exhausted creature suffers another effect that

causes exhaustion, its current level of exhaustion increases

by the amount specified in the effect’s description.

A creature suffers the effect of its current level of

exhaustion as well as all lower levels.

For example, a creature

suffering level 2 exhaustion has its speed halved and has

disadvantage on ability checks.

An effect that removes exhaustion reduces its level as

specified in the effect’s description, with all exhaustion

effects ending if a creature’s exhaustion level is reduced

below 1.

App end ixB: God sof the Mul tiv ers e

RELIGION IS AN IMPORTANT PART OF LIFE IN

the worlds of the D&D multiverse.

When

gods walk the world, clerics channel divine

power, evil cults perform dark sacrifices in

subterranean lairs, and shining paladins

stand like beacons against the darkness, it’s

hard to be ambivalent about the deities and

deny the ir existence.

Many people in the worlds of D&D worship different

gods at different times and circum stances.

People in

the Forgotten Realms, for example, might pray to Sune

for luck in love, make an offering to W aukeen before

heading to the market, and pray to appease Talos when

a severe storm blows in—all in the sam e day.

Many

people have a favorite am ong the gods, one w hose ideals

and teachings the y make the ir own.

And a few people

dedicate the mselves entirely to a single god, usually

serving as a priest or champion of that god’s ideals.

Your DM determines which gods, if any, are worshiped

in his or her campaign.

From among the gods available,

you can choose a single deity for you r character to

serve, worship, or pay lip service to.

Or you can pick

a few that you r character prays to most often.

Or just

make a mental note of the gods w ho are revered in you r

DM ’s campaign so you can invoke the ir names when

appropriate.

If you’re playing a cleric or a character with

the Acolyte background, decide which god you r deity

serves or served, and consider the deity’s suggested

dom ains when selecting you r character’s domain.

D&DPa nth eon s

Each world in the D&D multiverse has its own

pantheons of deities, ranging in size from the teeming

pantheons of the Forgotten Realm s and Greyhawk to

the m ore focused religions of Eberron and Dragonlance.

Many of the nonhuman races worship the sam e gods on

different w orlds—Moradin, for example, is revered by

dwarves of the Forgotten Realms, Greyhawk, and many

other worlds.

### The Forgotten Realms

D ozens of deities are revered, worshiped, and feared

throughout the world of the Forgotten Realms.

At least

thirty deities are widely known across the Realms, and

many m ore are worshiped locally, by individual tribes,

small cults, or certain sects of larger religious temples.

The L ife and Dea thD oma ins

Many deities in this section suggest the Life domain,

particularly if the y are closely associated with healing,

protection, childbirth, nurturing, or fertility.

As described in

the chapter 3, though, the Life domain is incredibly broad,

and a cleric of any non-evil deity can choose it.

A number of other deities, mostly evil ones, suggest the

Death domain, which is detailed in the Dungeon Master’s

Guide.

Most clerics who choose this domain are evil NPCs,

but if you want to worship a god of death, consult you r

Dungeon Master.

### Greyhawk

The gods ofGreyhawk com e from at least four different

pantheons, representing the faiths of the various ethnic

groups that populated the continent of Oerik over the

ages.

As a result, the re’sagreat deal of overlap in the ir

portfolios: Pelor is the Flan god of the sun and Pholtus

is the Oeridian sun god, for example.

### Dragonlance

The gods of the world of Krynn are three families: seven

gods of good headed by Paladine and Mishakal, seven of

neutrality headed by Gilean, and seven of evil headed by

Takhisis and Sargonnas.

These deities have been called

by many different names and held in varying levels of

esteem by different peoples and cultures through the

w orld’s history, but the y are the only gods of this w orld—

the ir place fixed in the stars as constellations.

### Eberron

The world of Eberron has many different religions, but

the most important revolves around a pantheon called

the Sovereign Host and the ir malign shadow, the Dark

Six.

The gods of the Sovereign Host are thought to have

dom inion over every aspect of existence, and to speak

with a unified voice.

But the Dark Six are the primitive,

bloody, and cruel gods w ho offer a dissenting voice.

Eberron’s other religions are very different from the

traditional D&D pantheons.

The monotheistic Church

of the Silver Flame is devoted to fighting against evil in

the world, but plagued by corruption in its own ranks.

The philosophy of the Blood of Vol teaches that divinity

lies with in all mortal beings and reveres the undead

who have secured that immortality.

Various mad cults

are devoted to the dem ons and horrors imprisoned

in Eberron's Underdark (called Khyber, the Dragon

Below).

The followers of the Path of Light believe that

the w orld is heading toward a glorious future where

the shadows that cloud this world will be transformed

into light.

And two related nations of elves revere the ir

ancestral spirits: the Undying Court, preserved as

spirits or even undead forms, and the glorified Spirits

of the Past, the great heroes of ancient wars.

Non hum anD eit ie s

Certain gods closely associated with nonhuman races

are revered on many different worlds, though not always

in the same way.

The nonhuman races of the Forgotten

Realm s and Greyhawk share the se deities.

Nonhuman races often have whole pantheons of

the ir own.

Besides Moradin, for example, the dwarf

gods include M oradin’s wife, Berronar Truesilver, and

a number of other gods thought to be the ir children

and grandchildren: Abbathor, Clangeddin Silverbeard,

Dugmaren Brightmantle, Dumathoin, Gorm Gulthyn,

Haela Brightaxe, M arthammor Duin, Sharindlar, Thard

Harr, and Vergadain.

Individual clans and kingdom s of

dwarves might revere som e, all, or none of the se deities,

and som e have other gods unknown (or known by other

names) to outsiders.

The Celtic, Egyptian, Greek, and Norse pantheons are

fantasy interpretations of historical religions from our

w orld’s ancient times.

They include deities that are

most appropriate for use in a D&D game, divorced from

the ir historical context in the real world and united into

pantheons that serve the needs of the game.

The Cel t ic Pa nth eon

It’s said that som ething wild lurks in the heart of every

soul, a space that thrills to the sound of geese calling

at night, to the whispering wind through the pines, to

the unexpected red of mistletoe on an oak—and it is in

this space that the Celtic gods dwell.

They sprang from

the brook and stream, the ir might heightened by the

strength of the oak and the beauty of the woodlands and

open moor.

W hen the first forester dared put a name to

the face seen in the bole of a tree or the voice babbling

in a brook, the se gods forced the mselves into being.

The Celtic gods are as often served by druids as by

clerics, for the y are closely aligned with the forces of

nature that druids revere.

The Gre ekPa nth eon

The gods of Olympus make the mselves known with the

gentle lap of waves against the shores and the crash of

the thunder am ong the cloud-enshrouded peaks.

The

thick boar-infested w oods and the sere, olive-covered

hillsides hold evidence of the ir passing.

Every aspect

of nature echoes with the ir presence, and the y’ve made

a place for the mselves inside the human heart, too.

The Egy pti anPa nth eon

These gods are a you ng dynasty of an ancient divine

family, heirs to the rulership of the cosm os and the

maintenance of the divine principle of Ma’at—the

fundamental order of truth, justice, law, and order that

puts gods, mortal pharaohs, and ordinary men and

w om en in the ir logical and rightful place in the universe.

The Egyptian pantheon is unusual in having three

gods with the Death dom ain ofdifferent alignments.

Anubis is the lawful neutral god of the afterlife, who

Fa nta s y - H is tor ic alPa nth eon s

judges the souls of the dead.

Set is a chaotic evil god

of murder, perhaps best known for killing his brother

Osiris.

And Nephthys is a chaotic good goddess of

mourning.

Thus, although m ost clerics of the Death

domain (found in the Dungeon Master's Guide) are

villainous characters, clerics w ho serve Anubis or

Nephthys need not be.

The Nor sePa nth eon

W here the land plummets from the snowy hills into the

icy fjords below, where the longboats draw up on to the

beach, where the glaciers flow forward and retreat with

every fall and spring—this is the land of the Vikings,

the hom e of the Norse pantheon.

It’sabrutal clime,

and one that calls for brutal living.

The w arriors of

the land have had to adapt to the harsh conditions in

order to survive, but the y have n’t been too twisted by

the needs of the ir environment.

Given the necessity of

raiding for food and wealth, it’s surprising the mortals

turned out as well as the y did.

Their powers reflect

the need the se warriors had for strong leadership and

decisive action.

Thus, the y see the ir deities in every

bend of a river, hear the m in the crash of the thunder

and the boom ing of the glaciers, and smell the m in the

sm oke of a burning longhouse.

The Norse pantheon includes two main families, the

Aesir (deities of war and destiny) and the Vanir (gods

of fertility and prosperity).

Once enemies, the se two

families are now closely allied against the ir com m on

enemies, the giants (including the gods Surtur and

Thrym).

Like the gods of Greyhawk, gods in different

families som etim es have overlap in the ir spheres of

influence: Frey (of the Vanir) and Odur (of the Aesir)

are both associated with the sun, for example.

INCREDIBLY VAST IS THE COSMOS OF THE

Dun geo n s & Dra gon s game, which teems

with a multitude ofworlds as well as myriad

alternate dim ensions of reality, called the planes

of existence.

It encom passes every world

where Dungeon Masters run the ir adventures,

all with in the relatively mundane realm of the

Material Plane.

Beyond that plane are domains

of raw elemental matter and energy, realm s of pure

thought and ethos, the hom es of dem ons and angels,

and the dom inions of the gods.

Many spells and magic items can draw energy

from the se planes, sum m on the creatures that dwell

the re, com m unicate with the ir denizens, and allow

adventurers to travel the re.

As you r character achieves

greater power and higher levels, you might undertake

a quest to rescue a friend from the horrific depths of

the Abyss, or find you rself hoisting a tankard with the

friendly giants of Ysgard.

You might w alk on streets

made of solid fire or test you r mettle on a battlefield

where the fallen are resurrected with each dawn.

The Mat eria lPl ane

The Material Plane is the nexus where the philosophical

and elemental forces that define the other planes collide

in the jum bled existence of mortal life and mundane

matter.

All the worlds of D&D exist with in the Material

Plane, making it the starting point for most campaigns

and adventures.

The rest of the multiverse is defined in

relation to the Material Plane.

The worlds of the Material Plane are infinitely diverse,

for the y reflect the creative imagination of the DMs

who set the ir gam es the re, as well as the players w hose

heroes adventure the re.

They include magic-wasted

desert planets and island-dotted water worlds, worlds

where magic com bines with advanced technology and

others trapped in an endless Stone Age, worlds where

the gods walk and places the y have abandoned.

The best-known worlds in the multiverse are the

ones that have been published as official campaign

settings for the D&D game over the years—Greyhawk,

Blackmoor, Dragonlance, the Forgotten Realms,

Mystara, Birthright, Dark Sun, and Eberron, among

others.

Each of the se worlds boasts its own cast of

heroic adventurers and schem ing villains, its own

ancient ruins and forgotten artifacts, its own dungeons

and its own dragons.

But if you r campaign takes place

on one of the se worlds, it belongs to you r DM—you

might imagine it as one of thousands of parallel versions

of the world, which might diverge wildly from the

published version.

### Material Echoes

The Material Plane is a richly magical place, and its

magical nature is reflected in the two planes that share

its central place in the multiverse.

The Feywild and the

Shadowfell are parallel dim ensions occupying the same

cosm ological space, so the y are often called echo planes

or mirror planes to the Material Plane.

The w orlds and

landscapes of the se planes mirror the natural world

of the Material Plane but reflect those features into

different form s—m ore marvelous and magical in the

Feywild, distorted and colorless in the Shadowfell.

W here a volcano stands in the Material Plane, a

mountain topped with skyscraper-sized crystals that

glow with internal fire towers in the Feywild, and a

jagged rock outcropping resembling a skull marks the

spot on the Shadowfell.

The Feywild, also called the Plane of Faerie, is a land

of soft lights and wonder, a country of little people with

great desires, a place of music and death.

It is a realm

of eternal twilight, with slow lanterns bobbing in the

gentle breeze and huge fireflies buzzing through groves

and fields.

The sky is alight with the faded colors of

the setting, or perhaps rising, sun.

But, in fact, the sun

never truly sets or rises; it remains stationary, dusky

and low in the sky.

Away from the settled areas ruled by

the Seelie Court, the land is a tangle of sharp-toothed

brambles and syrupy fens—perfect territory for the

Unseelie to hunt the ir prey.

Fey creatures, such as those

brought to the world by conjure woodland beings and

similar spells, dwell in the Feywild.

The Shadowfell, also called the Plane ofShadow, is

a darkly lighted dimension, a world of black and white

where color has been leached from everything.

It is a

place of toxic darkness that hates the light, where the

sky is a black vault with neither sun nor stars.

### Positiveand Negative Planes

Like a dome above the other planes, the Positive Plane is the

source of radiant energy and the raw life force that suffuses

all living beings, from the puny to the sublime.

Its dark

reflection is the Negative Plane, the source of necrotic energy

that destroys the living and animates the undead.

Bey ond the Mat eria l

Beyond the Material Plane, the various planes of

existence are realm s of myth and mystery.

They’re

not simply other worlds, but different qualities of

being, formed and governed by spiritual and elemental

principles abstracted from the ordinary world.

### Planar Travel

W hen adventurers travel into other planes of existence,

the y are undertaking a legendary journey across the

thresholds of existence to a mythic destination where

the y strive to complete the ir quest.

Such a journey is the

stuff of legend.

Braving the realm s of the dead, seeking

out the celestial servants of a deity, or bargaining with

an efreeti in its hom e city will be the subject of song and

story for years to com e.

Travel to the planes beyond the Material Plane can be

accom plished in two ways: by casting a spell or by using

a planar portal.

Spells.

A number of spells allow direct or indirect

access to other planes of existence.

Plane shift and

gate can transport adventurers directly to any other

plane of existence, with different degrees of precision.

Etherealness allows adventurers to enter the Ethereal

Plane and travel from the re to any of the planes it

touches—the Shadowfell, the Feywild, or the Elemental

Planes.

And the astral projection spell lets adventurers

project the mselves into the Astral Plane and travel to

the Outer Planes.

Portals.

A portal is a general term for a stationary

interplanar connection that links a specific location

on one plane to a specific location on another.

Som e

portals are like doorways, a clear window, or a fog-

shrouded passage, and simply stepping through it

effects the interplanar travel.

Others are locations—

circles of standing stones, soaring towers, sailing ships,

or even whole towns—that exist in multiple planes at

once or flicker from one plane to another in turn.

Som e

are vortices, typically joining an Elemental Plane with a

very similar location on the Material Plane, such as the

heart of a volcano (leading to the Plane ofFire) or the

depths of the ocean (to the Plane of Water).

### Transitive Planes

The Ethereal Plane and the Astral Plane are called the

Transitive Planes.

They are mostly featureless realms

that serve primarily as ways to travel from one plane

to another.

Spells such as etherealness and astral

projection allow characters to enter the se planes and

traverse the m to reach the planes beyond.

The Ethereal Plane is a misty, fog-bound dimension

that is som etim es described as a great ocean.

Its shores,

called the Border Ethereal, overlap the Material Plane

and the Inner Planes, so that every location on those

planes has a corresponding location on the Ethereal

Plane.

Certain creatures can see into the Border

Ethereal, and the see invisibility and true seeing spell

grant that ability.

Som e magical effects also extend from

the Material Plane into the Border Ethereal, particularly

effects that use force energy such as forcecage and wall

offorce.

The depths of the plane, the Deep Ethereal, are

a region of swirling mists and colorful fogs.

The Astral Plane is the realm ofthought and dream,

where visitors travel as disem bodied souls to reach

the planes of the divine and dem onic.

It is a great,

silvery sea, the sam e above and below, with swirling

w isps of white and gray streaking am ong motes of light

resem bling distant stars.

Erratic w hirlpools of color

flicker in midair like spinning coins.

Occasional bits of

solid matter can be found here, but most of the Astral

Plane is an endless, open domain.

### Inner Planes

The Inner Planes surround and enfold the Material

Plane and its echoes, providing the raw elemental

substance from which all the w orlds were made.

The

four Elemental Planes—Air, Earth, Fire, and Water—

form a ring around the Material Plane, suspended

with in the churning Elemental Chaos.

At the ir innermost edges, where the y are closest

to the Material Plane (in a conceptual if not a literal

geographical sense), the four Elemental Planes

resemble a world in the Material Plane.

The four

elements mingle together as the y do in the Material

Plane, forming land, sea, and sky.

Farther from the

Material Plane, though, the Elemental Planes are both

alien and hostile.

Here, the elements exist in the ir

purest form—great expanses of solid earth, blazing fire,

crystal-clear water, and unsullied air.

These regions

are little-known, so when discussing the Plane of Fire,

for example, a speaker usually m eans just the border

region.

At the farthest extents of the Inner Planes,

the pure elements dissolve and bleed together into an

unending tumult of clashing energies and colliding

substance, the Elemental Chaos.

### Outer Planes

If the Inner Planes are the raw matter and energy that

makes up the multiverse, the Outer Planes are the

direction, thought and purpose for such construction.

Accordingly, many sages refer to the Outer Planes as

divine planes, spiritual planes, or godly planes, for the

Outer Planes are best known as the hom es of deities.

W hen discussing anything to do with deities, the

language used must be highly metaphorical.

Their

actual hom es are not literally “places” at all, but

exemplify the idea that the Outer Planes are realm s of

thought and spirit.

As with the Elemental Planes, one

can imagine the perceptible part of the Outer Planes as

a sort of border region, while extensive spiritual regions

lie beyond ordinary sensory experience.

Even in those perceptible regions, appearances

can be deceptive.

Initially, many of the Outer Planes

appear hospitable and familiar to natives of the

Material Plane.

But the landscape can change at the

whim s of the powerful forces that live on the Outer

Planes.

The desires of the mighty forces that dwell on

the se planes can remake the m completely, effectively

erasing and rebuilding existence itself to better fulfill

the ir own needs.

Distance is a virtually m eaningless concept on the

Outer Planes.

The perceptible regions of the planes

often seem quite small, but the y can also stretch on to

what seem s like infinity.

It might be possible to take

a guided tour of the Nine Hells, from the first layer to

the ninth, in a single day—if the powers of the Hells

desire it.

Or it could take weeks for travelers to make a

grueling trek across a single layer.

The most well-known Outer Planes are a group of

sixteen planes that correspond to the eight alignments

(excluding neutrality) and the shades of distinction

between the m.

The planes with som e element of good in the ir nature

are called the Upper Planes.

Celestial creatures such

as angels and pegasi dwell in the Upper Planes.

Planes

with som e element of evil are the Lower Planes.

Fiends

such as dem ons, devils, and yugoloths dwell in the

Lower Planes.

A plane’s alignment is its essence, and

a character w hose alignment doesn’t match the plane’s

experiences a profound sense of dissonance the re.

W hen a good creature visits Elysium, for example, it

feels in tune with the plane, but an evil creature feels

out oftune and m ore than a little uncomfortable.

### Other Planes

Existing som ehow between or beyond the known planes

of existence are a variety of other realms.

### Sigilandthe Outlands

The Outlands is the plane between the Outer Planes, a

plane of neutrality, but not the neutrality of nothingness.

Instead it incorporates a little of everything, keeping it

all in a paradoxical balance—simultaneously concordant

and in opposition.

It is a broad region of varied terrain,

with open prairies, towering mountains, and twisting,

shallow rivers, strongly resembling an ordinary world

of the Material Plane.

The Outlands is circular, like a great w heel—in fact,

those w ho envision the Outer Planes as a wheel point

to the Outlands as proof, calling it amicrocosm of the

planes.

That argument might be circular, however,

for it is possible that the arrangement of the Outlands

inspired the idea of the Great W heel in the first place.

Around the outside edge of the circle, evenly spaced,

are the gate-towns: sixteen settlements, each built

around a portal leading to one ofthe Outer Planes.

Each

town shares many of the characteristics of the plane

where its gate leads.

At the center of the Outlands, like the axle of the

planar wheel, the Spire shoots im possibly high into the

sky.

Above this thin peak floats the ring-shaped city of

Sigil, the City of Doors.

This bustling planar m etropolis

holds countless portals to other planes and worlds.

Sigil is a trader’s city.

G oods, merchandise, and

information com e to it from across the planes.

There

is a brisk trade in information about the planes, in

particular in the com m and words or items required for

the operation of particular portals.

These portal keys

are highly sought after, and many travelers with in the

city are looking for a particular portal or a portal key

to allow the m to continue on the ir way.

### Demiplanes

Demiplanes are small extradimensional spaces with

the ir own unique rules.

They are pieces of reality that

don’t seem to fit anywhere else.

Demiplanes com e

into being by a variety ofmeans.

Som e are created by

spells, such as demiplane, or generated at the desire of a

powerful deity or other force.

They may exist naturally,

as a fold ofexisting reality that has been pinched off

from the rest of the multiverse, or as a baby universe

growing in power.

A given demiplane can be entered

through a single point where it touches another plane.

Theoretically, a plane shift spell can also carry travelers

to a demiplane, but the proper frequency required

for the tuning fork is extremely hard to acquire.

The

gate spell is m ore reliable, assum ing the caster knows

of the demiplane.

The Fa rRe alm

The Far Realm is beyond the known multiverse.

In fact,

it might be an entirely separate multiverse with its own

physical and magical laws.

W here stray energies from

the Far Realm leak onto another plane, life and matter

are warped and twisted into alien shapes that defy

ordinary geometry and biology.

The entities that abide in the Far Realm are too alien

for a normal mind to accept with out damage.

Titanic

creatures swim through nothingness, preoccupied

with m adness.

Unspeakable things whisper awful

truths to those w ho dare listen.

For mortals, knowledge

of the Far Realm is a triumph of mind over the rude

boundaries of matter, space, and eventually sanity.

There are no known portals to the Far Realm, or

at least none that are still viable.

Ancient elves once

pierced the boundary of eons with a vast portal to the

Far Realm with in a mountain called Firestorm Peak,

but the ir civilization im ploded in bloody terror and

the portal’s location—even its home world—is long-

forgotten.

Other portals might still exist, marked by the

alien forces leaking through to corrupt the Material

Plane around the m.

INSPIRATION FOR ALL OF THE FANTASY WORK I HAVE

done stems directly from the love my father

showed when I was a lad, for he spent many

hours telling me stories he made up as he went

along, tales ofcloaked old men who could grant

wishes, of magic rings and enchanted swords,

or wicked sorcerers and dauntless swordsmen. .

..

All of us tend to get ample helpings of fantasy

when we are very you ng, from fairy tales such as those

written by the Brothers Grimm and Andrew Lang.

This often leads to reading books of mythology, paging

through bestiaries, and consultation of compilations

of the myths of various lands and peoples.

Upon such

a base I built my interest in fantasy, being an avid

reader of all science fiction and fantasy literature

since 1950.

The following authors were of particular

inspiration to me.
