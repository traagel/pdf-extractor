        \ called the Midwestern United\n\nStates\u2014specifically the states o f\
        \ Minne\xAD\n\nsota and W isconsin\u2014a group of friends\n\ngathered together\
        \ to forever alter the\n\nhistory o f gaming.\n\nIt wasn\u2019t their intent\
        \ to do so.\n\nThey were\n\ntired of merely reading tales about worlds of\
        \ magic,\n\nmonsters, and adventure.\n\nThey wanted to play in those\n\nworlds,\
        \ rather than observe them.\n\nThat they went on\n\nto invent D u n g e o\
        \ n s & D r a g o n s , and thereby ignite a\n\nrevolution in gaming that\
        \ continues to this day, speaks\n\nto two things.\n\nFirst, it speaks to their\
        \ ingenuity and genius in fig\xAD\n\nuring out that gam es w ere the perfect\
        \ way to explore\n\nw orlds that could not otherwise exist.\n\nAlm ost every\n\
        \nm odern game, whether played on a digital device or\n\na tabletop, ow es\
        \ som e debt to D&D.\n\nSecond, it is a testament to the inherent appeal of\
        \ the\n\ngame they created.\n\nD u n g e o n s & D r a g o n s sparked a\n\
        \nthriving global phenomenon.\n\nIt is the first roleplaying\n\ngame, and\
        \ it remains one of the best of its breed.\n\nTo play D&D, and to play it\
        \ well, you don\u2019t need to\n\nread all the rules, m em orize every detail\
        \ of the game,\n\nor master the fine art o f rolling funny looking dice.\n\
        \nNone of those things have any bearing on what\u2019s best\n\nabout the game.\n\
        \nW hat you need are two things, the first being friends\n\nwith whom you\
        \ can share the game.\n\nPlaying games with\n\nyour friends is a lot of fun,\
        \ but D&D does som ething\n\nm ore than entertain.\n\nPlaying D&D is an exercise\
        \ in collaborative creation.\n\nYou and your friends create epic stories filled\
        \ with ten\xAD\n\nsion and memorable drama.\n\nYou create silly in-jokes\n\
        \nthat make you laugh years later.\n\nThe dice will be cruel\n\nto you, but\
        \ you will soldier on.\n\nYour collective creativ\xAD\n\nity will build stories\
        \ that you will tell again and again,\n\nranging from the utterly absurd to\
        \ the stuff of legend.\n\nIf you don\u2019t have friends interested in playing,\
        \ don\u2019t\n\nworry.\n\nThere\u2019s a special alchemy that takes place\n\
        \naround a D&D table that nothing else can match.\n\nPlay\n\nthe game with\
        \ som eone enough, and the two of you\n\nare likely to end up friends.\n\n\
        It\u2019s a cool side effect o f the\n\ngame.\n\nYour next gaming group is\
        \ as close as the nearest\n\ngame store, online forum, or gaming convention.\n\
        \nThe second thing you need is a lively imagination\n\nor, m ore importantly,\
        \ the willingness to use whatever\n\nimagination you have.\n\nYou don\u2019\
        t need to be a master\n\nstoryteller or a brilliant artist.\n\nYou just need\
        \ to aspire to\n\ncreate, to have the courage of som eone who is willing to\n\
        \nbuild som ething and share it with others.\n\nLuckily, just as D&D can strengthen\
        \ your friendships,\n\nit can help build in you the confidence to create and\n\
        \nshare.\n\nD&D is a game that teaches you to look for the\n\nclever solution,\
        \ share the sudden idea that can overcom e\n\na problem, and push yourself\
        \ to imagine what could be,\n\nrather than simply accept what is.\n\nThe first\
        \ characters and adventures you create will\n\nprobably be a collection of\
        \ cliches.\n\nThat\u2019s true of every\xAD\n\none, from the greatest Dungeon\
        \ Masters in history on\n\ndown.\n\nAccept this reality and move on to create\
        \ the\n\nsecond character or adventure, which will be better,\n\nand then\
        \ the third, w hich will be better still.\n\nRepeat that\n\nover the course\
        \ of time, and soon you\u2019ll be able to create\n\nanything, from a character\u2019\
        s background story to an epic\n\nworld of fantasy adventure.\n\nOnce you have\
        \ that skill, it\u2019s yours forever.\n\nCountless\n\nwriters, artists, and\
        \ other creators can trace their begin\xAD\n\nnings to a few pages o f D&D\
        \ notes, a handful of dice,\n\nand a kitchen table.\n\nAbove all else, D&D\
        \ is yours.\n\nThe friendships you\n\nmake around the table will be unique\
        \ to you.\n\nThe adven\xAD\n\ntures you embark on, the characters you create,\
        \ the\n\nm em ories you make\u2014these will be yours.\n\nD&D is your\n\n\
        personal corner of the universe, a place where you have\n\nfree reign to do\
        \ as you wish.\n\nG o forth now.\n\nRead the rules of the game and the\n\n\
        story of its worlds, but always remember that you are\n\nthe one who brings\
        \ them to life.\n\nThey are nothing\n\nwithout the spark of life that you\
        \ give them.\n\nMike Mearls\n\nMay 2014\n\nIn t r o d u c t io n\n\nThe D\
        \ u n g e o n s & D r a g o n s r o le p la y in g\n\ngame is about storytelling\
        \ in w orlds of\n\nsw ords and sorcery.\n\nIt shares elements\n\nwith childhood\
        \ games of make-believe.\n\nLike\n\nthose games, D & D is driven by imagina\xAD\
        \n\ntion.\n\nIt\u2019s about picturing the towering castle\n\nbeneath the\
        \ stormy night sky and imagining\n\nhow a fantasy adventurer might react to\
        \ the challenges\n\nthat scene presents.\n\nDungeon Master (DM): After passing\
        \ through the\n\ncraggy peaks, the road takes a sudden turn to the east\n\n\
        and Castle Ravenloft towers before you.\n\nCrumbling\n\ntowers of stone keep\
        \ a silent watch over the approach.\n\nThey look like abandoned guardhouses.\n\
        \nBeyond these,\n\na wide chasm gapes, disappearing into the deep\n\nfog below.\n\
        \nA lowered drawbridge spans the chasm,\n\nleading to an arched entrance to\
        \ the castle courtyard.\n\nThe chains of the drawbridge creak in the wind,\
        \ their\n\nrust-eaten iron straining with the weight.\n\nFrom atop\n\nthe\
        \ high strong walls, stone gargoyles stare at you\n\nfrom hollow sockets and\
        \ grin hideously.\n\nA rotting\n\nwooden portcullis, green with growth, hangs\
        \ in the\n\nentry tunnel.\n\nBeyond this, the main doors of Castle\n\nRavenloft\
        \ stand open, a rich warm light spilling into\n\nthe courtyard.\n\nPhillip\
        \ (playing Gareth): I want to look at the\n\ngargoyles.\n\nI have a feeling\
        \ they\u2019re not just statues.\n\nAmy (playing Riva): The drawbridge looks\
        \ precarious?\n\nI want to see how sturdy it is.\n\nDo I think we can cross\n\
        \nit, or is it going to collapse under our weight?\n\nUnlike a game of make-believe,\
        \ D&D gives structure\n\nto the stories, a way of determining the consequences\n\
        \nof the adventurers\u2019 action.\n\nPlayers roll dice to resolve\n\nwhether\
        \ their attacks hit or m iss or whether their adven\xAD\n\nturers can scale\
        \ a cliff, roll away from the strike of a\n\nm agical lightning bolt, or pull\
        \ off som e other dangerous\n\ntask.\n\nAnything is possible, but the dice\
        \ make som e out\xAD\n\ncom es m ore probable than others.\n\nDungeon Master\
        \ (DM): OK, one at a time.\n\nPhillip,\n\nyou\u2019re looking at the gargoyles?\n\
        \nPhillip: Yeah.\n\nIs there any hint they might be\n\ncreatures and not decorations?\n\
        \nDM: Make an Intelligence check.\n\nPhillip: Does my Investigation skill\
        \ apply?\n\nDM: Sure!\n\nPhillip (rolling a d20): Ugh.\n\nSeven.\n\nDM: They\
        \ look like decorations to you.\n\nAnd Amy,\n\nRiva is checking out the drawbridge?\n\
        \nIn the D u n g e o n s & D r a g o n s game, each player\n\ncreates an adventurer\
        \ (also called a character) and\n\nteams up with other adventurers (played\
        \ by friends).\n\nW orking together, the group might explore a dark dun\xAD\
        \n\ngeon, a ruined city, a haunted castle, a lost temple deep\n\nin a jungle,\
        \ or a lava-filled cavern beneath a mysterious\n\nmountain.\n\nThe adventurers\
        \ can solve puzzles, talk with\n\nother characters, battle fantastic monsters,\
        \ and discover\n\nfabulous magic items and other treasure.\n\nOne player,\
        \ however, takes on the role of the Dungeon\n\nMaster (DM), the gam e\u2019\
        s lead storyteller and referee.\n\nThe DM creates adventures for the characters,\
        \ who nav\xAD\n\nigate its hazards and decide which paths to explore.\n\n\
        The\n\nDM might describe the entrance to Castle Ravenloft,\n\nand the players\
        \ decide what they want their adventurers\n\nto do.\n\nWill they walk across\
        \ the dangerously weathered\n\ndrawbridge?\n\nTie themselves together with\
        \ rope to mini\xAD\n\nm ize the chance that som eone will fall if the drawbridge\n\
        \ngives way?\n\nOr cast a spell to carry them over the chasm?\n\nThen the\
        \ DM determines the results of the adventur\xAD\n\ners\u2019 actions and narrates\
        \ what they experience.\n\nBecause\n\nthe DM can improvise to react to anything\
        \ the players\n\nattempt, D&D is infinitely flexible, and each adventure\n\
        \ncan be exciting and unexpected.\n\nThe game has no real end; when one story\
        \ or quest\n\nwraps up, another one can begin, creating an ongoing\n\nstory\
        \ called a campaign.\n\nMany people who play the\n\ngame keep their cam paigns\
        \ going for months or years,\n\nmeeting with their friends every week or so\
        \ to pick\n\nup the story where they left off.\n\nThe adventurers grow\n\n\
        in might as the campaign continues.\n\nEach monster\n\ndefeated, each adventure\
        \ completed, and each treasure\n\nrecovered not only adds to the continuing\
        \ story, but also\n\nearns the adventurers new capabilities.\n\nThis increase\n\
        \nin power is reflected by an adventurer\u2019s level.\n\nThere\u2019s no\
        \ winning and losing in the D u n g e o n s &\n\nD r a g o n s game\u2014\
        at least, not the way those terms are\n\nusually understood.\n\nTogether,\
        \ the D M and the players\n\ncreate an exciting story of bold adventurers\
        \ who confront\n\ndeadly perils.\n\nSom etim es an adventurer might com e\
        \ to\n\na grisly end, torn apart by ferocious monsters or done in\n\nby a\
        \ nefarious villain.\n\nEven so, the other adventurers can\n\nsearch for powerful\
        \ magic to revive their fallen comrade,\n\nor the player might choose to create\
        \ a new character to\n\ncarry on.\n\nThe group might fail to complete an adventure\n\
        \nsuccessfully, but if everyone had a good time and created\n\na memorable\
        \ story, they all win.\n\nW o r ld s of A d v e n t u r e\n\nThe many worlds\
        \ of the D u n g e o n s & D r a g o n s game\n\nare places o f magic and\
        \ monsters, of brave warriors and\n\nspectacular adventures.\n\nThey begin\
        \ with a foundation\n\nof medieval fantasy and then add the creatures, places,\n\
        \nand magic that make these worlds unique.\n\nThe worlds of the D u n g e\
        \ o n s & D r a g o n s game exist\n\nwithin a vast cosm os called the multiverse,\
        \ connected\n\nin strange and mysterious ways to one another and to\n\nother\
        \ planes of existence, such as the Elemental Plane\n\nof Fire and the Infinite\
        \ Depths of the Abyss.\n\nWithin\n\nthis multiverse are an endless variety\
        \ of worlds.\n\nMany\n\nof them have been published as official settings for\
        \ the\n\nD&D game.\n\nThe legends of the Forgotten Realms, Drag-\n\nonlance,\
        \ Greyhawk, Dark Sun, Mystara, and Eberron\n\nsettings are woven together\
        \ in the fabric of the multi-\n\nverse.\n\nAlongside these worlds are hundreds\
        \ of thousands\n\nmore, created by generations of D&D players for their\n\n\
        own games.\n\nAnd amid all the richness of the multiverse,\n\nyou might create\
        \ a world of your own.\n\nAll these worlds share characteristics, but each\
        \ world\n\nis set apart by its own history and cultures, distinctive\n\nmonsters\
        \ and races, fantastic geography, ancient dun\xAD\n\ngeons, and schem ing\
        \ villains.\n\nSom e races have unusual\n\ntraits in different worlds.\n\n\
        The halflings of the Dark Sun\n\nsetting, for example, are jungle-dwelling\
        \ cannibals,\n\nand the elves are desert nomads.\n\nSom e worlds feature\n\
        \nraces unknown in other settings, such as Eberron\u2019s war-\n\nforged,\
        \ soldiers created and im bued with life to fight in\n\nthe Last War.\n\n\
        Som e worlds are dominated by one great\n\nstory, like the War of the Lance\
        \ that plays a central role\n\nin the Dragonlance setting.\n\nBut they\u2019\
        re all D&D worlds,\n\nand you can use the rules in this book to create a char\xAD\
        \n\nacter and play in any one of them.\n\nYour DM might set the campaign on\
        \ one of these\n\nworlds or on one that he or she created.\n\nBecause there\n\
        \nis so much diversity am ong the worlds of D&D, you\n\nshould check with\
        \ your DM about any house rules that\n\nwill affect your play of the game.\n\
        \nUltimately, the Dun\xAD\n\ngeon Master is the authority on the campaign\
        \ and its\n\nsetting, even if the setting is a published world.\n\nU s in\
        \ g T h is B o o k\n\nThe Player\u2019s Handbook is divided into three parts.\n\
        \nPart 1 is about creating a character, providing the\n\nrules and guidance\
        \ you need to make the character\n\nyou\u2019ll play in the game.\n\nIt includes\
        \ information on the\n\nvarious races, classes, backgrounds, equipment, and\n\
        \nother customization options that you can choose from.\n\nMany of the rules\
        \ in part 1 rely on material in parts 2\n\nand 3.\n\nIf you com e across a\
        \ game concept in part 1 that\n\nyou don\u2019t understand, consult the book\u2019\
        s index.\n\nPart 2 details the rules of how to play the game,\n\nbeyond the\
        \ basics described in this introduction.\n\nThat\n\npart covers the kinds\
        \ of die rolls you make to determine\n\nsuccess or failure at the tasks your\
        \ character attempts,\n\nand describes the three broad categories o f activity\
        \ in\n\nthe game: exploration, interaction, and combat.\n\nPart 3 is all about\
        \ magic.\n\nIt covers the nature of magic\n\nin the worlds of D&D, the rules\
        \ for spellcasting, and the\n\nhuge variety o f spells available to magic-using\
        \ charac\xAD\n\nters (and monsters) in the game.\n\nHow t o Pl a y\n\nThe\
        \ play of the D u n g e o n s & D r a g o n s game unfolds\n\naccording to\
        \ this basic pattern.\n\n1.\n\nThe DM describes the environment.\n\nThe DM\n\
        \ntells the players where their adventurers are and what\u2019s\n\naround\
        \ them, presenting the basic scope of options that\n\npresent themselves (how\
        \ many doors lead out of a room,\n\nwhat\u2019s on a table, w ho\u2019s in\
        \ the tavern, and so on).\n\n2.\n\nThe players describe what they want to\
        \ do.\n\nS om e\xAD\n\ntimes one player speaks for the whole party, saying,\n\
        \n\u201CW e\u2019ll take the east door,\u201D for example.\n\nOther times,\n\
        \ndifferent adventurers do different things: one adventurer\n\nmight search\
        \ a treasure chest while a second exam ines\n\nan esoteric sym bol engraved\
        \ on a wall and a third keeps\n\nwatch for monsters.\n\nThe players don\u2019\
        t need to take\n\nturns, but the DM listens to every player and decides\n\n\
        how to resolve those actions.\n\nSom etim es, resolving a task is easy.\n\n\
        If an adventurer\n\nwants to walk across a room and open a door, the DM\n\n\
        might just say that the door opens and describe what\n\nlies beyond.\n\nBut\
        \ the door might be locked, the floor\n\nmight hide a deadly trap, or som\
        \ e other circum stance\n\nmight make it challenging for an adventurer to\
        \ complete\n\na task.\n\nIn those cases, the DM decides what happens,\n\n\
        often relying on the roll of a die to determine the results\n\nof an action.\n\
        \n3.\n\nThe DM narrates the results of the adventurers\u2019\n\nactions.\n\
        \nDescribing the results often leads to another\n\ndecision point, which brings\
        \ the flow of the game right\n\nback to step 1.\n\nThis pattern holds whether\
        \ the adventurers are cau\xAD\n\ntiously exploring a ruin, talking to a devious\
        \ prince, or\n\nlocked in mortal combat against a mighty dragon.\n\nIn\n\n\
        certain situations, particularly combat, the action is\n\nm ore structured\
        \ and the players (and DM) do take turns\n\nchoosing and resolving actions.\n\
        \nBut m ost of the time,\n\nplay is fluid and flexible, adapting to the circum\
        \ stances\n\nof the adventure.\n\nOften the action of an adventure takes place\
        \ in the\n\nimagination of the players and DM, relying on the DM \u2019s\n\
        \nverbal descriptions to set the scene.\n\nSom e DMs like to\n\nuse music,\
        \ art, or recorded sound effects to help set the\n\nm ood, and many players\
        \ and DMs alike adopt different\n\nvoices for the various adventurers, monsters,\
        \ and other\n\ncharacters they play in the game.\n\nSom etim es, a DM\n\n\
        might lay out a map and use tokens or miniature figures\n\nto represent each\
        \ creature involved in a scene to help\n\nthe players keep track of where\
        \ everyone is."
      title: Character Sheet
    - content: "The game uses polyhedral dice with different numbers\n\nof sides.\n\
        \nYou can find dice like these in game stores and\n\nin many bookstores.\n\
        \nIn these rules, the different dice are referred to by the\n\nletter d followed\
        \ by the number of sides: d4, d6, d8, d 10,\n\nd 12, and d20.\n\nFor instance,\
        \ a d6 is a six-sided die (the\n\ntypical cube that many gam es use).\n\n\
        Percentile dice, or d 100, work a little differently.\n\nYou\n\ngenerate a\
        \ number between 1 and 100 by rolling two\n\ndifferent ten-sided dice num\
        \ bered from 0 to 9.\n\nOne die\n\n(designated before you roll) gives the\
        \ tens digit, and\n\nthe other gives the ones digit.\n\nIf you roll a 7 and\
        \ a 1, for\n\nexample, the number rolled is 71.\n\nTwo Os represent 100.\n\
        \nSom e ten-sided dice are numbered in tens (00, 10, 20,\n\nand so on), making\
        \ it easier to distinguish the tens digit\n\nfrom the ones digit.\n\nIn this\
        \ case, a roll of 70 and 1 is 71,\n\nand 00 and 0 is 100.\n\nW hen you need\
        \ to roll dice, the rules tell you how\n\nmany dice to roll o f a certain\
        \ type, as well as what m od\xAD\n\nifiers to add.\n\nFor example, \u201C\
        3d8 + 5 \u201D means you roll\n\nthree eight-sided dice, add them together,\
        \ and add 5\n\nto the total.\n\nThe sam e d notation appears in the expressions\
        \ \u201C1d3\u201D\n\nand \u201C1d2.\u201D To simulate the roll of 1d3, roll\
        \ a d6 and\n\ndivide the num ber rolled by 2 (round up).\n\nTo simulate\n\n\
        the roll of 1d2, roll any die and assign a 1 or 2 to the roll\n\ndepending\
        \ on whether it w as odd or even. (Alternatively,\n\nif the number rolled\
        \ is m ore than half the number of\n\nsides on the die, it\u2019s a 2.)\n\n\

        \ avoid the main blast of a fireball,\n\nor does he or she take full damage\
        \ from the blaze?\n\nIn\n\ncases w here the outcom e of an action is uncertain,\n\
        \nthe D u n g e o n s & D r a g o n s game relies on rolls o f a\n\n20-sided\
        \ die, a d20, to determine success or failure.\n\nEvery character and monster\
        \ in the game has capa\xAD\n\nbilities defined by six ability scores.\n\n\
        The abilities are\n\nStrength, Dexterity, Constitution, Intelligence, W isdom,\n\
        \nand Charisma, and they typically range from 3 to 18\n\nfor m ost adventurers.\
        \ (Monsters might have scores as\n\nlow as 1 or as high as 30.) These ability\
        \ scores, and the\n\nability modifiers derived from them, are the basis for\n\
        \nalmost every d20 roll that a player m akes on a charac\xAD\n\nter\u2019\
        s or monster\u2019s behalf.\n\nAbility checks, attack rolls, and saving throws\
        \ are the\n\nthree main kinds of d20 rolls, forming the core of the\n\nrules\
        \ of the game.\n\nAll three follow these simple steps.\n\n1.\n\nRoll the die\
        \ and add a modifier.\n\nRoll a d20 and\n\nadd the relevant modifier.\n\n\
        This is typically the m od\xAD\n\nifier derived from one of the six ability\
        \ scores, and it\n\nsom etim es includes a proficiency bonus to reflect a\
        \ char\xAD\n\nacter\u2019s particular skill. (See chapter 1 for details on\
        \ each\n\nability and how to determine an ability\u2019s modifier.)\n\n2.\n\
        \nApply circumstantial bonuses and penalties.\n\nA\n\nclass feature, a spell,\
        \ a particular circum stance, or som e\n\nother effect might give a bonus\
        \ or penalty to the check.\n\n3.\n\nCompare the total to a target number.\n\
        \nIf the total\n\nequals or exceeds the target number, the ability check,\n\
        \nattack roll, or saving throw is a success.\n\nOtherwise, it\u2019s\n\na\
        \ failure.\n\nThe DM is usually the one w ho determines\n\ntarget numbers\
        \ and tells players whether their ability\n\nchecks, attack rolls, and saving\
        \ throws succeed or fail.\n\nThe target number for an ability check or a saving\n\
        \nthrow is called a Difficulty Class (DC).\n\nThe target\n\nnumber for an\
        \ attack roll is called an Armor Class (AC).\n\nThis simple rule governs the\
        \ resolution of m ost tasks\n\nin D&D play.\n\nChapter 7 provides m ore detailed\
        \ rules for\n\nusing the d20 in the game."
      title: Game Dice
    - content: "Som etim es an ability check, attack roll, or saving throw\n\nis modified\
        \ by special situations called advantage and\n\ndisadvantage.\n\nAdvantage\
        \ reflects the positive circum \xAD\n\nstances surrounding a d20 roll, while\
        \ disadvantage\n\nreflects the opposite.\n\nW hen you have either advantage\
        \ or\n\ndisadvantage, you roll a second d20 w hen you make the\n\nroll.\n\n\
        Use the higher of the two rolls if you have advan\xAD\n\ntage, and use the\
        \ lower roll if you have disadvantage.\n\nFor example, if you have disadvantage\
        \ and roll a 17 and\n\na 5, you use the 5.\n\nIf you instead have advantage\
        \ and roll\n\nthose numbers, you use the 17.\n\nMore detailed rules for advantage\
        \ and disadvantage\n\nare presented in chapter 7."

      title: Adventures

        \ what happens.\n\nSocial interaction features the adventurers talking to\n\
        \nsom eone (or som ething) else.\n\nIt might mean demanding\n\nthat a captured\
        \ scout reveal the secret entrance to the\n\ngoblin lair, getting information\

        \nsocial interaction, as do many class features in chapter 3\n\nand personality\

        of D&D, there are two kinds of high elves.


        One type


        (which includes the gray elves and valley elves of


        Greyhawk, the Silvanesti of Dragonlance, and the


        sun elves of the Forgotten Realms) is haughty and


        reclusive, believing themselves to be superior to


        non-elves and even other elves.


        The other type


        (including the high elves of Greyhawk. the


        Qualinesti of Dragonlance, and the m oon elves


        of the Forgotten Realms) are m ore com m on


        and m ore friendly, and often encountered


        am ong humans and other races.


        The sun elves of Faerun (also called gold


        elves or sunrise elves) have bronze skin and


        hair of copper, black, or golden blond.


        Their


        eyes are golden, silver, or black.


        M oon elves (also


        called silver elves or gray elves) are much paler,


        with alabaster skin som etim es tinged with blue.


        They often have hair of silver-white, black, or blue,


        but various shades of blond, brown, and red are


        not uncom m on.


        Their eyes are blue or green and


        flecked with gold.

        \ her bare hands as she did to the last six rivals.\n\nFrothing at the mouth,\
        \ a dwarf slam s his helmet into\n\nthe face of his drow foe, then turns to\
        \ drive his armored\n\nelbow into the gut o f another.\n\nThese barbarians,\
        \ different as they might be, are\n\ndefined by their rage: unbridled, unquenchable,\
        \ and\n\nunthinking fury.\n\nMore than a mere emotion, their anger\n\nis the\
        \ ferocity of a cornered predator, the unrelenting\n\nassault of a storm,\
        \ the churning turmoil o f the sea.\n\nFor som e, their rage springs from\
        \ a com m union\n\nwith fierce animal spirits.\n\nOthers draw from a roiling\n\
        \nreservoir of anger at a world full of pain.\n\nFor every\n\nbarbarian, rage\
        \ is a power that fuels not just a battle\n\nfrenzy but also uncanny reflexes,\
        \ resilience, and\n\nfeats of strength.\n\nPeople of towns and cities take\
        \ pride in how their\n\ncivilized ways set them apart from animals, as if\n\
        \ndenying one\u2019s ow n nature was a mark of superiority.\n\nTo\n\na barbarian,\
        \ though, civilization is no virtue, but a sign\n\nof weakness.\n\nThe strong\
        \ em brace their animal nature-\n\nkeen instincts, primal physicality, and\
        \ ferocious rage.\n\nBarbarians are uncom fortable when hedged in by walls\n\
        \nand crowds.\n\nThey thrive in the wilds o f their homelands:\n\nthe tundra,\
        \ jungle, or grasslands where their tribes\n\nlive and hunt.\n\nBarbarians\
        \ com e alive in the chaos of combat.\n\nThey can enter a berserk state where\
        \ rage takes over,\n\ngiving them superhuman strength and resilience.\n\n\
        A\n\nbarbarian can draw on this reservoir of fury only a few\n\ntimes without\
        \ resting, but those few rages are usually\n\nsufficient to defeat whatever\
        \ threats arise.\n\nA L i f e o f D a n g e r\n\nNot every m em ber of the\
        \ tribes deem ed \u201Cbarbarians\u201D\n\nby scions of civilized society\
        \ has the barbarian class.\n\nA\n\ntrue barbarian am ong these people is as\
        \ uncom m on as\n\na skilled fighter in a town, and he or she plays a similar\n\
        \nrole as a protector of the people and a leader in times\n\nof war.\n\nLife\
        \ in the wild places of the world is fraught\n\nwith peril: rival tribes,\
        \ deadly weather, and terrifying\n\nmonsters.\n\nBarbarians charge headlong\
        \ into that danger\n\nso that their people don\u2019t have to.\n\nTheir courage\
        \ in the face of danger makes barbarians\n\nperfectly suited for adventuring.\n\
        \nW andering is often a\n\nway of life for their native tribes, and the rootless\
        \ life of\n\nthe adventurer is little hardship for a barbarian.\n\nSom e\n\
        \nbarbarians m iss the close-knit family structures of the\n\ntribe, but eventually\
        \ find them replaced by the bonds\n\nformed among the mem bers of their adventuring\

        \nand Ulaa.\n\nIn the worlds of Greyhawk and the Forgotten Realms,\n\ndruidic\
        \ circles are not usually connected to the faith of a\n\nsingle nature deity.\n\
        \nAny given circle in the Forgotten Realms,\n\nfor example, might include\

        \ are\n\noften called the First Circle, the first among the druids, and\n\n\
        most druids count them all (even the violent ones) as worthy\n\nof veneration.\n\

        \ spells, then, are\n\na means to communicate with and command these spirits.\n\

        \ proper relationship of these spirits to each other\n\nand to the forces\
        \ of civilization.\n\nThe Ashbound, for example,\n\nbelieve that arcane magic\

        DM might require you to find a buyer in a large town or\n\nlarger community\

        \ access to a variety\n\nof armor types, ranging from leather armor to chain\n\
        \nmail to costly plate armor, with several other kinds of\n\narmor in between.\n\
        \nThe Arm or table collects the most\n\ncom m only available types of armor\
        \ found in the game\n\nand separates them into three categories: light armor,\n\
        \nmedium armor, and heavy armor.\n\nMany warriors\n\nsupplement their armor\
        \ with a shield.\n\nV a r i a n t : E q u i p m e n t S i z e s\n\nIn most\
        \ campaigns, you can use or wear any equipment that\n\nyou find on your adventures,\

        \ fit in a halfling\u2019s\n\nleather armor, and a gnome would be swallowed\
        \ up in a\n\ncloud giant\u2019s elegant robe.\n\nThe DM can impose more realism.\n\
        \nFor example, a suit of\n\nplate armor made for one human might not fit another\
        \ one\n\nwithout significant alterations, and a guard\u2019s uniform might\n\
        \nbe visibly ill-fitting when an adventurer tries to wear it as a\n\ndisguise.\n\
        \nUsing this variant, when adventurers find armor, clothing,\n\nand similar\
        \ items that are made to be worn, they might need\n\nto visit an armorsmith,\
        \ tailor, leatherworker, or similar expert\n\nto make the item wearable.\n\
        \nThe cost for such work varies\n\nfrom 10 to 40 percent of the market price\
        \ of the item.\n\nThe\n\nDM can either roll 1d4 x 10 or determine the increase\
        \ in cost\n\nbased on the extent of the alterations required.\n\nThe Arm or\
        \ table shows the cost, weight, and other\n\nproperties of the com m on types\

        \ interferes with the\n\nw earer\u2019s ability to move quickly, stealthily,\

        The two


        categories are simple and martial.


        Most people can


        use simple w eapons with proficiency.


        These weapons


        include clubs, m aces, and other w eapons often found in


        the hands of com m oners.


        Martial w eapons, including


        swords, axes, and polearm s, require m ore specialized


        training to use effectively.


        M ost warriors use martial


        w eapons because these w eapons put their fighting style


        and training to best use.


        Proficiency with a w eapon allows you to add your


        proficiency bonus to the attack roll for any attack you


        make with that weapon.


        If you make an attack roll using


        a w eapon with w hich you lack proficiency, you do not


        add your proficiency bonus to the attack roll.'

        \ to fire from the weapon.\n\nEach\n\ntime you attack with the weapon, you\
        \ expend one piece\n\nof ammunition.\n\nDrawing the ammunition from a quiver,\n\
        \ncase, or other container is part of the attack.\n\nAt the\n\nend of the\
        \ battle, you can recover half your expended\n\nammunition by taking a minute\
        \ to search the battlefield.\n\nYour class grants proficiency in certain weapons,\n\
        \nreflecting both the class's focus and the tools you are\n\nmost likely to\
        \ use.\n\nW hether you favor a longsword or\n\na longbow, your w eapon and\
        \ your ability to wield it\n\neffectively can m ean the difference between\

        \nEvery weapon is classified\n\nas either melee or ranged.\n\nA melee weapon\
        \ is used to\n\nattack a target within 5 feet of you, whereas a ranged\n\n\
        weapon is used to attack a target at a distance.\n\nIf you use a weapon that\
        \ has the ammunition property\n\nto make a melee attack, you treat the weapon\
        \ as an\n\nimprovised weapon (see \"Improvised Weapons\" later in\n\nthe section).\n\
        \nA sling must be loaded to deal any damage\n\nwhen used in this way.\n\n\
        Finesse.\n\nWhen making an attack with a finesse\n\nweapon, you use your choice\
        \ o f your Strength or\n\nDexterity modifier for the attack and damage rolls.\n\

        \ for use when fighting with two weapons.\n\nSee the rules for two-weapon\
        \ fighting in chapter 9.\n\nLoading.\n\nBecause of the time required to load\
        \ this\n\nweapon, you can fire only one piece of ammunition\n\nfrom it when\
        \ you use an action, bonus action, or reaction\n\nto fire it, regardless of\

        \ can be used to make a ranged\n\nattack has a range shown in parentheses\
        \ after the\n\nammunition or thrown property.\n\nThe range lists two\n\nnumbers.\n\
        \nThe first is the w eapon\u2019s normal range in feet,\n\nand the second\
        \ indicates the w eapon\u2019s maximum range.\n\nW hen attacking a target\

        Reach.\n\nThis w eapon adds 5 feet to your reach when\n\nyou attack with it.\n\
        \nSpecial.\n\nA w eapon with the special property has\n\nunusual rules governing\
        \ its use, explained in the\n\nw eapon\u2019s description (see \"Special W\
        \ eapons\" later in\n\nthis section).\n\nThrown.\n\nIf a weapon has the thrown\
        \ property, you\n\ncan throw the w eapon to make a ranged attack.\n\nIf the\n\
        \nweapon is a melee weapon, you use the same ability\n\nm odifier for that\
        \ attack roll and damage roll that you\n\nwould use for a melee attack with\
        \ the weapon.\n\nFor\n\nexample, if you throw a handaxe, you use your Strength,\n\
        \nbut if you throw a dagger, you can use either your\n\nStrength or your Dexterity,\
        \ since the dagger has the\n\nfinesse property.\n\nTwo-Handed.\n\nThis w eapon\

        reach 6th level, he can decide whether to add another\n\nfighter level (becoming\

        \nwhat spells you know and can prepare for each class\n\nindividually, as\
        \ if you were a single-classed mem ber of\n\nthat class.\n\nIf you are a ranger\
        \ 4/wizard 3, for example,\n\nyou know three 1st-level ranger spells based\
        \ on your\n\nlevels in the ranger class.\n\nAs 3rd-level wizard, you know\n\
        \nthree w izard cantrips, and your spellbook contains ten\n\nwizard spells,\
        \ two of which (the two you gained when\n\nyou reached 3rd level as a wizard)\
        \ can be 2nd-level\n\nspells.\n\nIf your Intelligence is 16, you can prepare\
        \ six\n\nwizard spells from your spellbook.\n\nEach spell you know and prepare\
        \ is associated with one\n\nof your classes, and you use the spellcasting\
        \ ability of that\n\nclass when you cast the spell.\n\nSimilarly, a spellcasting\n\
        \nfocus, such as a holy symbol, can be used only for the\n\nspells from the\
        \ class associated with that focus.\n\nSpell Slots.\n\nYou determine your\
        \ available spell slots\n\nby adding together all your levels in the bard,\
        \ cleric,\n\ndruid, sorcerer, and wizard classes, half your levels\n\n(rounded\
        \ down) in the paladin and ranger classes, and\n\na third o f your fighter\
        \ or rogue levels (rounded down)\n\nif you have the Eldritch Knight or the\
        \ Arcane Trickster\n\nfeature.\n\nUse this total to determine your spell slots\
        \ by\n\nconsulting the Multiclass Spellcaster table.\n\nIf you have m ore\
        \ than one spellcasting class, this table\n\nmight give you spell slots of\
        \ a level that is higher than\n\nthe spells you know or can prepare.\n\nYou\
        \ can use those\n\nslots, but only to cast your lower-level spells.\n\nIf\
        \ a lower-\n\nlevel spell that you cast, like burning hands, has an\n\nenhanced\
        \ effect when cast using a higher-level slot, you\n\ncan use the enhanced\
        \ effect, even though you don\u2019t have\n\nany spells of that higher level.\n\
        \nFor example, if you are the aforementioned ranger 4/\n\nwizard 3, you count\
        \ as a 5th-level character when\n\ndetermining your spell slots: you have\
        \ four 1st-level\n\nslots, three 2nd-level slots, and two 3rd-level slots.\n\
        \nHowever, you don\u2019t know any 3rd-level spells, nor do you\n\nknow any\
        \ 2nd-level ranger spells.\n\nYou can use the spell\n\nslots of those levels\
        \ to cast the spells you do know\u2014and\n\npotentially enhance their effects.\n\
        \nPact Magic.\n\nIf you have both the Spellcasting class\n\nfeature and the\
        \ Pact Magic class feature from the warlock\n\nclass, you can use the spell\
        \ slots you gain from the Pact\n\nMagic feature to cast spells you know or\
        \ have prepared\n\nfrom classes with the Spellcasting class feature, and you\n\
        \ncan use the spell slots you gain from the Spellcasting\n\nclass feature\

        a saving throw, or an attack roll.\n\nW hen that happens,\n\nyou roll a second\
        \ d20 when you make the roll.\n\nUse the\n\nhigher of the two rolls if you\
        \ have advantage, and use\n\nthe lower roll if you have disadvantage.\n\n\
        For example, if\n\nyou have disadvantage and roll a 17 and a 5, you use the\n\
        \n5.\n\nIf you instead have advantage and roll those numbers,\n\nyou use the\
        \ 17.\n\nIf multiple situations affect a roll and each one grants\n\nadvantage\
        \ or im poses disadvantage on it, you don\u2019t roll\n\nm ore than one additional\
        \ d20.\n\nIf two favorable situations\n\ngrant advantage, for example, you\
        \ still roll only one\n\nadditional d20.\n\nIf circum stances cause a roll\
        \ to have both advantage\n\nand disadvantage, you are considered to have neither\
        \ of\n\nthem, and you roll one d20.\n\nThis is true even if multiple\n\ncircum\
        \ stances im pose disadvantage and only one grants\n\nadvantage or vice versa.\n\
        \nIn such a situation, you have\n\nneither advantage nor disadvantage.\n\n\
        W hen you have advantage or disadvantage and\n\nsom ething in the game, such\
        \ as the halfling\u2019s Lucky\n\ntrait, lets you reroll the d20, you can\
        \ reroll only one\n\nof the dice.\n\nYou choose which one.\n\nFor example,\
        \ if a\n\nhalfling has advantage on an ability check and rolls\n\na 1 and\
        \ a 13, the halfling could use the Lucky trait to\n\nreroll the 1.\n\nYou\
        \ usually gain advantage or disadvantage through\n\nthe use of special abilities,\
        \ actions, or spells.\n\nInspiration\n\n(see chapter 4) can also give a character\
        \ advantage on\n\nchecks related to the character\u2019s personality, ideals,\n\
        \nor bonds.\n\nThe DM can also decide that circum stances\n\ninfluence a roll\
        \ in one direction or the other and grant\n\nadvantage or im pose disadvantage\
        \ as a result.\n\nP r o f ic ie n c y B o n u s\n\nCharacters have a proficiency\
        \ bonus determined by\n\nlevel, as detailed in chapter 1.\n\nMonsters also\
        \ have this\n\nbonus, which is incorporated in their stat blocks.\n\nThe\n\
        \nbonus is used in the rules on ability checks, saving\n\nthrows, and attack\
        \ rolls.\n\nYour proficiency bonus can\u2019t be added to a single die\n\n\
        roll or other number m ore than once.\n\nFor example, if\n\ntwo different\
        \ rules say you can add your proficiency\n\nbonus to a W isdom saving throw,\
        \ you nevertheless add\n\nthe bonus only once when you make the save.\n\n\
        Occasionally, your proficiency bonus might be\n\nmultiplied or divided (doubled\
        \ or halved, for example)\n\nbefore you apply it.\n\nFor example, the rogue's\
        \ Expertise\n\nfeature doubles the proficiency bonus for certain ability\n\
        \nchecks.\n\nIf a circum stance suggests that your proficiency\n\nbonus applies\
        \ m ore than once to the sam e roll, you still\n\nadd it only once and multiply\
        \ or divide it only once.\n\nBy the sam e token, if a feature or effect allows\
        \ you\n\nto multiply your proficiency bonus when making an\n\nability check\
        \ that w ouldn\u2019t normally benefit from your\n\nproficiency bonus, you\
        \ still don\u2019t add the bonus to the\n\ncheck.\n\nFor that check your proficiency\
        \ bonus is 0, given\n\nthe fact that multiplying 0 by any number is still\
        \ 0.\n\nFor\n\ninstance, if you lack proficiency in the History skill,\n\n\

        \ a\n\ndangerous cliff, the Dungeon Master might ask for a\n\nStrength (Athletics)\
        \ check.\n\nIf the character is proficient\n\nin Athletics, the character\u2019\

        Normally, your proficiency in a skill applies only to a\n\nspecific kind of\
        \ ability check.\n\nProficiency in Athletics,\n\nfor example, usually applies\
        \ to Strength checks.\n\nIn som e\n\nsituations, though, your proficiency\
        \ might reasonably\n\napply to a different kind of check.\n\nIn such cases,\
        \ the DM\n\nmight ask for a check using an unusual combination of\n\nability\
        \ and skill, or you might ask your DM if you can\n\napply a proficiency to\
        \ a different check.\n\nFor example,\n\nif you have to swim from an offshore\
        \ island to the\n\nmainland, your DM might call for a Constitution check\n\
        \nto see if you have the stamina to make it that far.\n\nIn this\n\ncase,\
        \ your DM might allow you to apply your proficiency\n\nin Athletics and ask\
        \ for a Constitution (Athletics) check.\n\nS o if you\u2019re proficient in\
        \ Athletics, you apply your\n\nproficiency bonus to the Constitution check\
        \ just as you\n\nwould normally do for a Strength (Athletics) check.\n\nSimilarly,\
        \ when your half-orc barbarian uses a display\n\nof raw strength to intimidate\
        \ an enemy, your DM might\n\nask for a Strength (Intimidation) check, even\
        \ though\n\nIntimidation is normally associated with Charisma.\n\nPa s s iv\
        \ e C h e c k s\n\nA passive check is a special kind of ability check that\n\
        \ndoesn\u2019t involve any die rolls.\n\nSuch a check can represent\n\nthe\
        \ average result for a task done repeatedly, such as\n\nsearching for secret\
        \ doors over and over again, or can\n\nbe used when the DM wants to secretly\
        \ determine\n\nwhether the characters succeed at som ething without\n\nrolling\
        \ dice, such as noticing a hidden monster.\n\nHere\u2019s how to determine\
        \ a character\u2019s total for a\n\npassive check:\n\n10 + all modifiers that\
        \ normally apply to the check\n\nIf the character has advantage on the check,\
        \ add 5.\n\nFor\n\ndisadvantage, subtract 5.\n\nThe game refers to a passive\n\
        \ncheck total as a score.\n\nFor example, if a 1st-level character has a W\
        \ isdom of\n\n15 and proficiency in Perception, he or she has a passive\n\n\
        W isdom (Perception) score of 14.\n\nThe rules on hiding in the \u201CDexterity\u201D\

        Sometimes, it makes sense to split an adventuring party,


        especially if you want one or more characters to scout ahead.


        You can form multiple parties, each moving at a different speed.


        Each group has its own front, middle, and back ranks.


        The drawback to this approach is that the party will be split


        into several smaller groups in the event of an attack.


        The


        advantage is that a small group of stealthy characters moving


        slowly might be able to sneak past enemies that clumsier


        characters would alert.


        A rogue and a monk moving at a slow


        pace are much harder to detect when they leave their dwarf


        paladin friend behind.

        W hen combat starts, every participant makes a


        Dexterity check to determine their place in the initiative


        order.


        The DM makes one roll for an entire group of


        identical creatures, so each m em ber of the group acts at


        the same time.


        The DM ranks the combatants in order from the one


        with the highest Dexterity check total to the one with


        the lowest.


        This is the order (called the initiative order)


        in which they act during each round.


        The initiative order


        remains the same from round to round.


        If a tie occurs, the DM decides the order among


        tied DM-controlled creatures, and the players decide


        the order am ong their tied characters.


        The DM can


        decide the order if the tie is between a monster and a


        player character.


        Optionally, the DM can have the tied


        characters and monsters each roll a d20 to determine

        A melee attack


        typically uses a handheld weapon such as a sword,


        a warhammer, or an axe.


        A typical monster makes a


        melee attack when it strikes with its claws, horns, teeth,


        tentacles, or other body part.


        A few spells also involve


        making a melee attack.


        M ost creatures have a 5-foot reach and can thus


        attack targets within 5 feet of them when making a


        m elee attack.


        Certain creatures (typically those larger


        than Medium) have melee attacks with a greater reach


        than 5 feet, as noted in their descriptions.


        W hen you are unarmed, you can fight in melee by


        making an unarmed strike, as shown in the weapon


        table in chapter 5.'

        If a


        creature or an object has vulnerability to a damage


        type, damage of that type is doubled against it.


        Resistance and then vulnerability are applied after


        all other modifiers to damage.


        For example, a creature


        has resistance to bludgeoning damage and is hit by an


        attack that deals 25 bludgeoning damage.


        The creature


        is also within a m agical aura that reduces all damage by


        5.


        The 25 damage is first reduced by 5 and then halved,


        so the creature takes 10 damage.


        Multiple instances of resistance or vulnerability that


        affect the sam e damage type count as only one instance.


        For example, if a creature has resistance to fire damage


        as w ell as resistance to all nonm agical damage, the

        you and that has an appropriate anatomy can serve as a


        mount, using the following rules.'
      title: Mounted Combat
    - content: "Once during your move, you can mount a creature that\n\nis within\
        \ 5 feet of you or dismount.\n\nDoing so costs an\n\namount of movement equal\
        \ to half your speed.\n\nFor\n\nexample, if your speed is 30 feet, you must\
        \ spend 15\n\nfeet of movement to mount a horse.\n\nTherefore, you can\u2019\
        t\n\nmount it if you don\u2019t have 15 feet o f movement left or\n\nif your\
        \ speed is 0.\n\nIf an effect m oves your mount against its w ill while\n\n\
        you\u2019re on it, you must succeed on a DC 10 Dexterity\n\nsaving throw or\
        \ fall off the mount, landing prone in a\n\nspace within 5 feet of it.\n\n\
        If you\u2019re knocked prone while\n\nmounted, you must make the same saving\
        \ throw.\n\nIf your mount is knocked prone, you can use your\n\nreaction to\
        \ dismount it as it falls and land on your feet.\n\nOtherwise, you are dismounted\
        \ and fall prone in a\n\nspace within 5 feet it."

        \ Disengage, and\n\nDodge.\n\nA controlled mount can move and act even on\n\
        \nthe turn that you mount it.\n\nAn independent mount retains its place in\
        \ the\n\ninitiative order.\n\nBearing a rider puts no restrictions on\n\n\
        the actions the mount can take, and it m oves and acts\n\nas it wishes.\n\n\
        It might flee from combat, rush to attack\n\nand devour a badly injured foe,\
        \ or otherwise act against\n\nyour wishes.\n\nIn either case, if the mount\

        A spell\u2019s level is a\n\ngeneral indicator of how powerful it is, with\

        \ physically hampered by your armor for spellcasting.\n\nIn every case, the\

        \ m ore so.\n\nThus, each spellcasting class\u2019s\n\ndescription (except\

        \ of higher level.\n\nA 1st-level spell fits into a slot\n\nof any size, but\
        \ a 9th-level spell fits only in a 9th-level\n\nslot.\n\nS o when Umara casts\
        \ magic missile, a 1st-level\n\nspell, she spends one of her four 1st-level\
        \ slots and has\n\nthree remaining.\n\nFinishing a long rest restores any\
        \ expended spell slots\n\n(see chapter 8 for the rules on resting).\n\nSom\
        \ e characters and m onsters have special abilities\n\nthat let them cast\
        \ spells without using spell slots.\n\nFor\n\nexample, a m onk who follows\
        \ the Way o f the Four\n\nElements, a warlock who chooses certain eldritch\n\

        \ affected by the spell\u2019s magic.\n\nA spell's description\n\ntells you\
        \ whether the spell targets creatures, objects, or\n\na point of origin for\
        \ an area of effect (described below).\n\nUnless a spell has a perceptible\
        \ effect, a creature\n\nmight not know it w as targeted by a spell at all.\n\
        \nAn effect\n\nlike crackling lightning is obvious, but a m ore subtle\n\n\
        effect, such as an attempt to read a creature\u2019s thoughts,\n\ntypically\
        \ goes unnoticed, unless a spell says otherwise.\n\nA C l e a r Pa t h t o\
        \ t h e T a r g e t\n\nTo target something, you must have a clear path to\
        \ it,\n\nso it can\u2019t be behind total cover.\n\nIf you place an area of\
        \ effect at a point that you can\u2019t\n\nsee and an obstruction, such as\
        \ a wall, is between you\n\nand that point, the point o f origin com es into\
        \ being on\n\nthe near side of that obstruction."
      title: Targets
    - content: 'If a spell targets a creature of your choice, you can


        choose yourself, unless the creature must be hostile or


        specifically a creature other than you.


        If you are in the


        area of effect of a spell you cast, you can target yourself.'
      title: Targeting Yourself
    - content: "Spells such as burning hands and cone of cold cover an\n\narea, allowing\
        \ them to affect multiple creatures at once.\n\nA spell\u2019s description\
        \ specifies its area of effect,\n\nwhich typically has one of five different\
        \ shapes: cone,\n\ncube, cylinder, line, or sphere.\n\nEvery area of effect\
        \ has\n\na point of origin, a location from which the spell\u2019s\n\nenergy\
        \ erupts.\n\nThe rules for each shape specify how you\n\nposition its point\
        \ of origin.\n\nTypically,\n\na point of origin is a point in space, but\n\
        \nsom e spells have an area w hose origin is a\n\ncreature or an object.\n\
        \nA spell\u2019s effect expands in straight lines from the point\n\nof origin.\n\
        \nIf no unblocked straight line extends from the\n\npoint of origin to a location\
        \ within the area of effect, that\n\nlocation isn\u2019t included in the spell\u2019\
        s area.\n\nTo block one of\n\nthese imaginary lines, an obstruction must provide\
        \ total\n\ncover, as explained in chapter 9."
      title: Areasof Effect
    - content: "A cone extends in a direction you choose from its point\n\nof origin.\n\
        \nA cone\u2019s width at a given point along its length\n\nis equal to that\
        \ point\u2019s distance from the point of origin.\n\nA cone\u2019s area of\
        \ effect specifies its maximum length.\n\nA cone\u2019s point of origin is\
        \ not included in the cone\u2019s\n\narea of effect, unless you decide otherwise."
      title: Cone
    - content: "You select a cube\u2019s point of origin, which lies anywhere\n\n\
        on a face of the cubic effect.\n\nThe cube\u2019s size is expressed\n\nas\
        \ the length of each side.\n\nA cube\u2019s point of origin is not included\
        \ in the cube\u2019s\n\narea of effect, unless you decide otherwise."
      title: Cube
    - content: "A cylinder\u2019s point of origin is the center of a circle of a\n\
        \nparticular radius, as given in the spell description.\n\nThe\n\ncircle must\
        \ either be on the ground or at the height of\n\nthe spell effect.\n\nThe\
        \ energy in a cylinder expands in\n\nstraight lines from the point of origin\
        \ to the perimeter of\n\nthe circle, forming the base of the cylinder.\n\n\
        The spell\u2019s\n\neffect then shoots up from the base or down from the\n\
        \ntop, to a distance equal to the height of the cylinder.\n\nA cylinder\u2019\
        s point of origin is included in the cylinder\u2019s\n\narea of effect.\n\n\
        L in e\n\nA line extends from its point of origin in a straight path\n\nup\
        \ to its length and covers an area defined by its width.\n\nA line\u2019s\
        \ point of origin is not included in the line\u2019s area\n\nof effect, unless\
        \ you decide otherwise."
      title: Cylinder
    - content: "You select a sphere\u2019s point of origin, and the sphere\n\nextends\
        \ outward from that point.\n\nThe sphere\u2019s\n\nsize is expressed as a\
        \ radius in feet that extends\n\nfrom the point.\n\nA sphere\u2019s point\
        \ of origin is included in the sphere\u2019s\n\narea of effect."
      title: Sphere
    - content: "Many spells specify that a target can make a saving\n\nthrow to avoid\
        \ som e or all of a spell\u2019s effects.\n\nThe spell\n\nspecifies the ability\
        \ that the target uses for the save and\n\nwhat happens on a success or failure.\n\
        \nThe DC to resist one of your spells equals 8 + your\n\nspellcasting ability\
        \ modifier + your proficiency bonus +\n\nany special modifiers."
      title: Saving Throws
    - content: "Som e spells require the caster to make an attack roll\n\nto determine\
        \ whether the spell effect hits the intended\n\ntarget.\n\nYour attack bonus\
        \ with a spell attack equals your\n\nspellcasting ability m odifier + your\
        \ proficiency bonus.\n\nMost spells that require attack rolls involve ranged\n\
        \nattacks.\n\nRem ember that you have disadvantage on a\n\nranged attack roll\
        \ if you are within 5 feet of a hostile\n\ncreature that can see you and that\
        \ isn\u2019t incapacitated\n\n(see chapter 9)."
      title: Attack Rolls
    - content: "The effects of different spells add together while\n\nthe durations\
        \ of those spells overlap.\n\nThe effects of\n\nthe same spell cast multiple\
        \ times don't combine,\n\nhowever.\n\nInstead, the m ost potent effect\u2014\
        such as the\n\nhighest bonus\u2014from those castings applies while their\n\
        \ndurations overlap.\n\nFor example, if two clerics cast bless on the same\n\
        \ntarget, that character gains the spell\u2019s benefit only\n\nonce; he or\
        \ she doesn\u2019t get to roll two bonus dice.\n\nT h e W e a v e o f M a\
        \ g ic\n\nThe worlds within the D&D multiverse are magical places.\n\nAll\
        \ existence is suffused with magical power, and potential\n\nenergy lies untapped\
        \ in every rock, stream, and living\n\ncreature, and even in the air itself.\n\
        \nRaw magic is the stuff of\n\ncreation, the mute and mindless will of existence,\
        \ permeating\n\nevery bit of matter and present in every manifestation of\n\
        \nenergy throughout the multiverse.\n\nMortals can\u2019t directly shape this\
        \ raw magic.\n\nInstead, they\n\nmake use of a fabric of magic, a kind of\
        \ interface between\n\nthe will of a spellcaster and the stuff of raw magic.\n\
        \nThe\n\nspellcasters of the Forgotten Realms call it the Weave and\n\nrecognize\
        \ its essence as the goddess Mystra, but casters\n\nhave varied ways of naming\
        \ and visualizing this interface.\n\nBy\n\nany name, without the Weave, raw\
        \ magic is locked away and\n\ninaccessible;the most powerful archmage can't\
        \ light a candle\n\nwith magic in an area where the Weave has been torn.\n\
        \nBut\n\nsurrounded by the Weave, a spellcaster can shape lightning\n\nto\
        \ blast foes, transport hundreds of miles in the blink of an\n\neye, or even\
        \ reverse death itself.\n\nAll magic depends on the Weave, though different\
        \ kinds\n\nof magic access it in a variety of ways.\n\nThe spells of wizards,\n\
        \nwarlocks, sorcerers, and bards are commonly called arcane\n\nmagic.\n\n\
        These spells rely on an understanding\u2014 learned or\n\nintuitive\u2014\
        \ of the workings of the Weave.\n\nThe caster plucks\n\ndirectly at the strands\
        \ of the Weave to create the desired\n\neffect.\n\nEldritch knights and arcane\
        \ tricksters also use arcane\n\nmagic.\n\nThe spells of clerics, druids, paladins,\
        \ and rangers are\n\ncalled divine magic.\n\nThese spellcasters\u2019 access\
        \ to the Weave\n\nis mediated by divine power\u2014 gods, the divine forces\
        \ of\n\nnature, or the sacred weight of a paladin\u2019s oath.\n\nWhenever\
        \ a magic effect is created, the threads of the\n\nWeave intertwine, twist,\
        \ and fold to make the effect possible.\n\nWhen characters use divination\
        \ spells such as detect magic or\n\nidentify, they glimpse the Weave.\n\n\
        A spell such as dispel magic\n\nsmooths the Weave.\n\nSpells such as antimagic\
        \ field rearrange\n\nthe Weave so that magic flows around, rather than through,\n\
        \nthe area affected by the spell.\n\nAnd in places where the Weave\n\nis damaged\
        \ or torn, magic works in unpredictable ways\u2014 or\n\nnot at all."

        Its Constitution is 10 and its Intelligence and W isdom

        locom otion, it instead has a flying speed of 30 feet and


        can hover.


        If the object is securely attached to a surface


        or a larger object, such as a chain bolted to a wall, its


        speed is 0.


        It has blindsight with a radius of 30 feet and


        is blind beyond that distance.


        W hen the animated object


        drops to 0 hit points, it reverts to its original object


        form, and any remaining damage carries over to its


        original object form.


        If you com m and an object to attack, it can make a


        single melee attack against a creature within 5 feet


        of it.


        It makes a slam attack with an attack bonus and


        bludgeoning damage determined by its size.

        You write on parchment, paper, or som e other suitable


        writing material and imbue it with a potent illusion that


        lasts for the duration.


        To you and any creatures you designate when you


        cast the spell, the writing appears normal, written in


        your hand, and conveys whatever meaning you intended


        when you wrote the text.


        To all others, the writing


        appears as if it were written in an unknown or magical


        script that is unintelligible.


        Alternatively, you can cause


        the writing to appear to be an entirely different message,


        written in a different hand and language, though the


        language must be one you know.


        Should the spell be dispelled, the original script and


        the illusion both disappear.

        Components: V, S, M (a bit of fleece and jade dust worth

        Duration: Until dispelled


        You create an illusion of an object, a creature, or


        som e other visible phenom enon within range that


        activates when a specific condition occurs.


        The illusion


        is imperceptible until then.


        It must be no larger than a


        30-foot cube, and you decide when you cast the spell


        how the illusion behaves and what sounds it makes.


        This


        scripted perform ance can last up to 5 minutes.


        W hen the condition you specify occurs, the illusion


        springs into existence and perform s in the manner you


        described.


        Once the illusion finishes perform ing, it


        disappears and remains dormant for 10 minutes.


        After


        this time, the illusion can be activated again.


        The triggering condition can be as general or as


        detailed as you like, though it must be based on visual or


        audible conditions that occur within 30 feet of the area.


        For example, you could create an illusion of yourself


        to appear and warn off others who attempt to open a


        trapped door, or you could set the illusion to trigger only


        when a creature says the correct w ord or phrase.


        Physical interaction with the image reveals it to be an


        illusion, because things can pass through it.


        A creature


        that uses its action to examine the image can determine


        that it is an illusion with a successful Intelligence


        (Investigation) check against your spell save DC.


        If a


        creature discerns the illusion for what it is, the creature


        can see through the image, and any noise it makes


        sounds hollow to the creature.'

        within range that you have seen before, regardless of


        intervening obstacles.


        The illusion looks and sounds


        like you but is intangible.

        damage, it disappears, and the spell ends.


        You can use your action to move this illusion up to

        \ malign shadow, the Dark\n\nSix.\n\nThe gods of the Sovereign Host are thought\
        \ to have\n\ndom inion over every aspect of existence, and to speak\n\nwith\
        \ a unified voice.\n\nBut the Dark Six are the primitive,\n\nbloody, and cruel\

        \ very different from the\n\ntraditional D&D pantheons.\n\nThe monotheistic\
        \ Church\n\nof the Silver Flame is devoted to fighting against evil in\n\n\
        the world, but plagued by corruption in its own ranks.\n\nThe philosophy of\
        \ the Blood of Vol teaches that divinity\n\nlies within all mortal beings\
        \ and reveres the undead\n\nwho have secured that immortality.\n\nVarious\
        \ mad cults\n\nare devoted to the dem ons and horrors imprisoned\n\nin Eberron's\

        \ where\n\nthe shadows that cloud this world will be transformed\n\ninto light.\n\
        \nAnd two related nations of elves revere their\n\nancestral spirits: the\
        \ Undying Court, preserved as\n\nspirits or even undead forms, and the glorified\
        \ Spirits\n\nof the Past, the great heroes of ancient wars.\n\nN o n h u m\

        \nBesides Moradin, for example, the dwarf\n\ngods include M oradin\u2019s\

        Transitive Planes.


        They are mostly featureless realms


        that serve primarily as ways to travel from one plane


        to another.


        Spells such as etherealness and astral


        projection allow characters to enter these planes and


        traverse them to reach the planes beyond.


        The Ethereal Plane is a misty, fog-bound dimension


        that is som etim es described as a great ocean.


        Its shores,


        called the Border Ethereal, overlap the Material Plane


        and the Inner Planes, so that every location on those


        planes has a corresponding location on the Ethereal


        Plane.


        Certain creatures can see into the Border


        Ethereal, and the see invisibility and true seeing spell


        grant that ability.


        Som e magical effects also extend from


        the Material Plane into the Border Ethereal, particularly


        effects that use force energy such as forcecage and wall


        o f force.


        The depths of the plane, the Deep Ethereal, are


        a region of swirling mists and colorful fogs.


        The Astral Plane is the realm o f thought and dream,


        where visitors travel as disem bodied souls to reach


        the planes of the divine and dem onic.


        It is a great,


        silvery sea, the sam e above and below, with swirling


        w isps of white and gray streaking am ong motes of light


        resem bling distant stars.


        Erratic w hirlpools of color


        flicker in midair like spinning coins.

        \ the multiverse, the Outer Planes are the\n\ndirection, thought and purpose\
        \ for such construction.\n\nAccordingly, many sages refer to the Outer Planes\
        \ as\n\ndivine planes, spiritual planes, or godly planes, for the\n\nOuter\
        \ Planes are best known as the hom es of deities.\n\nW hen discussing anything\
        \ to do with deities, the\n\nlanguage used must be highly metaphorical.\n\n\
        Their\n\nactual hom es are not literally \u201Cplaces\u201D at all, but\n\n\
        exemplify the idea that the Outer Planes are realm s of\n\nthought and spirit.\n\
        \nAs with the Elemental Planes, one\n\ncan imagine the perceptible part of\
        \ the Outer Planes as\n\na sort of border region, while extensive spiritual\
        \ regions\n\nlie beyond ordinary sensory experience.\n\nEven in those perceptible\
        \ regions, appearances\n\ncan be deceptive.\n\nInitially, many of the Outer\
        \ Planes\n\nappear hospitable and familiar to natives of the\n\nMaterial Plane.\n\
        \nBut the landscape can change at the\n\nwhim s of the powerful forces that\
        \ live on the Outer\n\nPlanes.\n\nThe desires of the mighty forces that dwell\
        \ on\n\nthese planes can remake them completely, effectively\n\nerasing and\
        \ rebuilding existence itself to better fulfill\n\ntheir own needs.\n\nDistance\
        \ is a virtually m eaningless concept on the\n\nOuter Planes.\n\nThe perceptible\
        \ regions of the planes\n\noften seem quite small, but they can also stretch\
        \ on to\n\nwhat seem s like infinity.\n\nIt might be possible to take\n\n\
        a guided tour of the Nine Hells, from the first layer to\n\nthe ninth, in\
        \ a single day\u2014if the powers of the Hells\n\ndesire it.\n\nOr it could\
        \ take weeks for travelers to make a\n\ngrueling trek across a single layer.\n\
        \nThe most well-known Outer Planes are a group of\n\nsixteen planes that correspond\
        \ to the eight alignments\n\n(excluding neutrality) and the shades of distinction\n\
