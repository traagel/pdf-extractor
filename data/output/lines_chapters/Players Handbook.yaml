        - Preface
        - ONCE UPON A TIME, LONG, LONG AGO, IN A
        - realm called the Midwestern United
        - "States\u2014specifically the states o f Minne\xAD"
        - "sota and W isconsin\u2014a group of friends"
        - gathered together to forever alter the
        - history o f gaming.
        - "It wasn\u2019t their intent to do so."
        - They were
        - tired of merely reading tales about worlds of magic,
        - monsters, and adventure.
        - They wanted to play in those
        - worlds, rather than observe them.
        - That they went on
        - to invent D u n g e o n s & D r a g o n s , and thereby ignite a
        - revolution in gaming that continues to this day, speaks
        - to two things.
        - "First, it speaks to their ingenuity and genius in fig\xAD"
        - uring out that gam es w ere the perfect way to explore
        - w orlds that could not otherwise exist.
        - Alm ost every
        - m odern game, whether played on a digital device or
        - a tabletop, ow es som e debt to D&D.
        - Second, it is a testament to the inherent appeal of the
        - game they created.
        - D u n g e o n s & D r a g o n s sparked a
        - thriving global phenomenon.
        - It is the first roleplaying
        - game, and it remains one of the best of its breed.
        - "To play D&D, and to play it well, you don\u2019t need to"
        - read all the rules, m em orize every detail of the game,
        - or master the fine art o f rolling funny looking dice.
        - "None of those things have any bearing on what\u2019s best"
        - about the game.
        - W hat you need are two things, the first being friends
        - with whom you can share the game.
        - Playing games with
        - your friends is a lot of fun, but D&D does som ething
        - m ore than entertain.
        - Playing D&D is an exercise in collaborative creation.
        - "You and your friends create epic stories filled with ten\xAD"
        - sion and memorable drama.
        - You create silly in-jokes
        - that make you laugh years later.
        - The dice will be cruel
        - to you, but you will soldier on.
        - "Your collective creativ\xAD"
        - ity will build stories that you will tell again and again,
        - ranging from the utterly absurd to the stuff of legend.
        - "If you don\u2019t have friends interested in playing, don\u2019t"
        - worry.
        - "There\u2019s a special alchemy that takes place"
        - around a D&D table that nothing else can match.
        - Play
        - the game with som eone enough, and the two of you
        - are likely to end up friends.
        - "It\u2019s a cool side effect o f the"
        - game.
        - Your next gaming group is as close as the nearest
        - game store, online forum, or gaming convention.
        - The second thing you need is a lively imagination
        - or, m ore importantly, the willingness to use whatever
        - imagination you have.
        - "You don\u2019t need to be a master"
        - storyteller or a brilliant artist.
        - You just need to aspire to
        - create, to have the courage of som eone who is willing to
        - build som ething and share it with others.
        - Luckily, just as D&D can strengthen your friendships,
        - it can help build in you the confidence to create and
        - share.
        - D&D is a game that teaches you to look for the
        - clever solution, share the sudden idea that can overcom e
        - a problem, and push yourself to imagine what could be,
        - rather than simply accept what is.
        - The first characters and adventures you create will
        - probably be a collection of cliches.
        - "That\u2019s true of every\xAD"
        - one, from the greatest Dungeon Masters in history on
        - down.
        - Accept this reality and move on to create the
        - second character or adventure, which will be better,
        - and then the third, w hich will be better still.
        - Repeat that
        - "over the course of time, and soon you\u2019ll be able to create"
        - "anything, from a character\u2019s background story to an epic"
        - world of fantasy adventure.
        - "Once you have that skill, it\u2019s yours forever."
        - Countless
        - "writers, artists, and other creators can trace their begin\xAD"
        - nings to a few pages o f D&D notes, a handful of dice,
        - and a kitchen table.
        - Above all else, D&D is yours.
        - The friendships you
        - make around the table will be unique to you.
        - "The adven\xAD"
        - tures you embark on, the characters you create, the
        - "m em ories you make\u2014these will be yours."
        - D&D is your
        - personal corner of the universe, a place where you have
        - free reign to do as you wish.
        - G o forth now.
        - Read the rules of the game and the
        - story of its worlds, but always remember that you are
        - the one who brings them to life.
        - They are nothing
        - without the spark of life that you give them.
        - Mike Mearls
        - May 2014
        - In t r o d u c t io n
        - The D u n g e o n s & D r a g o n s r o le p la y in g
        - game is about storytelling in w orlds of
        - sw ords and sorcery.
        - It shares elements
        - with childhood games of make-believe.
        - Like
        - "those games, D & D is driven by imagina\xAD"
        - tion.
        - "It\u2019s about picturing the towering castle"
        - beneath the stormy night sky and imagining
        - how a fantasy adventurer might react to the challenges
        - that scene presents.
        - 'Dungeon Master (DM): After passing through the'
        - craggy peaks, the road takes a sudden turn to the east
        - and Castle Ravenloft towers before you.
        - Crumbling
        - towers of stone keep a silent watch over the approach.
        - They look like abandoned guardhouses.
        - Beyond these,
        - a wide chasm gapes, disappearing into the deep
        - fog below.
        - A lowered drawbridge spans the chasm,
        - leading to an arched entrance to the castle courtyard.
        - The chains of the drawbridge creak in the wind, their
        - rust-eaten iron straining with the weight.
        - From atop
        - the high strong walls, stone gargoyles stare at you
        - from hollow sockets and grin hideously.
        - A rotting
        - wooden portcullis, green with growth, hangs in the
        - entry tunnel.
        - Beyond this, the main doors of Castle
        - Ravenloft stand open, a rich warm light spilling into
        - the courtyard.
        - 'Phillip (playing Gareth): I want to look at the'
        - gargoyles.
        - "I have a feeling they\u2019re not just statues."
        - 'Amy (playing Riva): The drawbridge looks precarious?'
        - I want to see how sturdy it is.
        - Do I think we can cross
        - it, or is it going to collapse under our weight?
        - Unlike a game of make-believe, D&D gives structure
        - to the stories, a way of determining the consequences
        - "of the adventurers\u2019 action."
        - Players roll dice to resolve
        - "whether their attacks hit or m iss or whether their adven\xAD"
        - turers can scale a cliff, roll away from the strike of a
        - m agical lightning bolt, or pull off som e other dangerous
        - task.
        - "Anything is possible, but the dice make som e out\xAD"
        - com es m ore probable than others.
        - 'Dungeon Master (DM): OK, one at a time.'
        - Phillip,
        - "you\u2019re looking at the gargoyles?"
        - 'Phillip: Yeah.'
        - Is there any hint they might be
        - creatures and not decorations?
        - 'DM: Make an Intelligence check.'
        - 'Phillip: Does my Investigation skill apply?'
        - 'DM: Sure!'
        - 'Phillip (rolling a d20): Ugh.'
        - Seven.
        - 'DM: They look like decorations to you.'
        - And Amy,
        - Riva is checking out the drawbridge?
        - In the D u n g e o n s & D r a g o n s game, each player
        - creates an adventurer (also called a character) and
        - teams up with other adventurers (played by friends).
        - "W orking together, the group might explore a dark dun\xAD"
        - geon, a ruined city, a haunted castle, a lost temple deep
        - in a jungle, or a lava-filled cavern beneath a mysterious
        - mountain.
        - The adventurers can solve puzzles, talk with
        - other characters, battle fantastic monsters, and discover
        - fabulous magic items and other treasure.
        - One player, however, takes on the role of the Dungeon
        - "Master (DM), the gam e\u2019s lead storyteller and referee."
        - "The DM creates adventures for the characters, who nav\xAD"
        - igate its hazards and decide which paths to explore.
        - The
        - DM might describe the entrance to Castle Ravenloft,
        - and the players decide what they want their adventurers
        - to do.
        - Will they walk across the dangerously weathered
        - drawbridge?
        - "Tie themselves together with rope to mini\xAD"
        - m ize the chance that som eone will fall if the drawbridge
        - gives way?
        - Or cast a spell to carry them over the chasm?
        - "Then the DM determines the results of the adventur\xAD"
        - "ers\u2019 actions and narrates what they experience."
        - Because
        - the DM can improvise to react to anything the players
        - attempt, D&D is infinitely flexible, and each adventure
        - can be exciting and unexpected.
        - The game has no real end; when one story or quest
        - wraps up, another one can begin, creating an ongoing
        - story called a campaign.
        - Many people who play the
        - game keep their cam paigns going for months or years,
        - meeting with their friends every week or so to pick
        - up the story where they left off.
        - The adventurers grow
        - in might as the campaign continues.
        - Each monster
        - defeated, each adventure completed, and each treasure
        - recovered not only adds to the continuing story, but also
        - earns the adventurers new capabilities.
        - This increase
        - "in power is reflected by an adventurer\u2019s level."
        - "There\u2019s no winning and losing in the D u n g e o n s &"
        - "D r a g o n s game\u2014at least, not the way those terms are"
        - usually understood.
        - Together, the D M and the players
        - create an exciting story of bold adventurers who confront
        - deadly perils.
        - Som etim es an adventurer might com e to
        - a grisly end, torn apart by ferocious monsters or done in
        - by a nefarious villain.
        - Even so, the other adventurers can
        - search for powerful magic to revive their fallen comrade,
        - or the player might choose to create a new character to
        - carry on.
        - The group might fail to complete an adventure
        - successfully, but if everyone had a good time and created

        - The many worlds of the D u n g e o n s & D r a g o n s game
        - are places o f magic and monsters, of brave warriors and
        - spectacular adventures.
        - They begin with a foundation
        - of medieval fantasy and then add the creatures, places,
        - and magic that make these worlds unique.
        - The worlds of the D u n g e o n s & D r a g o n s game exist
        - within a vast cosm os called the multiverse, connected
        - in strange and mysterious ways to one another and to
        - other planes of existence, such as the Elemental Plane
        - of Fire and the Infinite Depths of the Abyss.
        - Within
        - this multiverse are an endless variety of worlds.
        - Many
        - of them have been published as official settings for the
        - D&D game.
        - The legends of the Forgotten Realms, Drag-
        - onlance, Greyhawk, Dark Sun, Mystara, and Eberron
        - settings are woven together in the fabric of the multi-
        - verse.
        - Alongside these worlds are hundreds of thousands
        - more, created by generations of D&D players for their
        - own games.
        - And amid all the richness of the multiverse,
        - you might create a world of your own.
        - All these worlds share characteristics, but each world
        - is set apart by its own history and cultures, distinctive
        - "monsters and races, fantastic geography, ancient dun\xAD"
        - geons, and schem ing villains.
        - Som e races have unusual
        - traits in different worlds.
        - The halflings of the Dark Sun
        - setting, for example, are jungle-dwelling cannibals,
        - and the elves are desert nomads.
        - Som e worlds feature
        - "races unknown in other settings, such as Eberron\u2019s war-"
        - forged, soldiers created and im bued with life to fight in
        - the Last War.
        - Som e worlds are dominated by one great
        - story, like the War of the Lance that plays a central role
        - in the Dragonlance setting.
        - "But they\u2019re all D&D worlds,"
        - "and you can use the rules in this book to create a char\xAD"
        - acter and play in any one of them.
        - Your DM might set the campaign on one of these
        - worlds or on one that he or she created.
        - Because there
        - is so much diversity am ong the worlds of D&D, you
        - should check with your DM about any house rules that
        - will affect your play of the game.
        - "Ultimately, the Dun\xAD"
        - geon Master is the authority on the campaign and its
        - setting, even if the setting is a published world.

        - "The Player\u2019s Handbook is divided into three parts."
        - Part 1 is about creating a character, providing the
        - rules and guidance you need to make the character
        - "you\u2019ll play in the game."
        - It includes information on the
        - various races, classes, backgrounds, equipment, and
        - other customization options that you can choose from.
        - Many of the rules in part 1 rely on material in parts 2
        - and 3.
        - If you com e across a game concept in part 1 that
        - "you don\u2019t understand, consult the book\u2019s index."
        - Part 2 details the rules of how to play the game,
        - beyond the basics described in this introduction.
        - That
        - part covers the kinds of die rolls you make to determine
        - success or failure at the tasks your character attempts,
        - and describes the three broad categories o f activity in
        - 'the game: exploration, interaction, and combat.'
        - Part 3 is all about magic.
        - It covers the nature of magic
        - in the worlds of D&D, the rules for spellcasting, and the
        - "huge variety o f spells available to magic-using charac\xAD"
        - ters (and monsters) in the game.
        - How t o Pl a y
        - The play of the D u n g e o n s & D r a g o n s game unfolds
        - according to this basic pattern.
        - '1.'
        - The DM describes the environment.
        - The DM
        - "tells the players where their adventurers are and what\u2019s"
        - around them, presenting the basic scope of options that
        - present themselves (how many doors lead out of a room,
        - "what\u2019s on a table, w ho\u2019s in the tavern, and so on)."
        - '2.'
        - The players describe what they want to do.
        - "S om e\xAD"
        - times one player speaks for the whole party, saying,
        - "\u201CW e\u2019ll take the east door,\u201D for example."
        - Other times,
        - 'different adventurers do different things: one adventurer'
        - might search a treasure chest while a second exam ines
        - an esoteric sym bol engraved on a wall and a third keeps
        - watch for monsters.
        - "The players don\u2019t need to take"
        - turns, but the DM listens to every player and decides
        - how to resolve those actions.
        - Som etim es, resolving a task is easy.
        - If an adventurer
        - wants to walk across a room and open a door, the DM
        - might just say that the door opens and describe what
        - lies beyond.
        - But the door might be locked, the floor
        - might hide a deadly trap, or som e other circum stance
        - might make it challenging for an adventurer to complete
        - a task.
        - In those cases, the DM decides what happens,
        - often relying on the roll of a die to determine the results
        - of an action.
        - '3.'
        - "The DM narrates the results of the adventurers\u2019"
        - actions.
        - Describing the results often leads to another
        - decision point, which brings the flow of the game right
        - back to step 1.
        - "This pattern holds whether the adventurers are cau\xAD"
        - tiously exploring a ruin, talking to a devious prince, or
        - locked in mortal combat against a mighty dragon.
        - In
        - certain situations, particularly combat, the action is
        - m ore structured and the players (and DM) do take turns
        - choosing and resolving actions.
        - But m ost of the time,
        - play is fluid and flexible, adapting to the circum stances
        - of the adventure.
        - Often the action of an adventure takes place in the
        - "imagination of the players and DM, relying on the DM \u2019s"
        - verbal descriptions to set the scene.
        - Som e DMs like to
        - use music, art, or recorded sound effects to help set the
        - m ood, and many players and DMs alike adopt different
        - voices for the various adventurers, monsters, and other
        - characters they play in the game.
        - Som etim es, a DM
        - might lay out a map and use tokens or miniature figures
        - to represent each creature involved in a scene to help
        - the players keep track of where everyone is.

        - The game uses polyhedral dice with different numbers
        - of sides.
        - You can find dice like these in game stores and
        - in many bookstores.
        - In these rules, the different dice are referred to by the
        - 'letter d followed by the number of sides: d4, d6, d8, d 10,'
        - d 12, and d20.
        - For instance, a d6 is a six-sided die (the
        - typical cube that many gam es use).
        - Percentile dice, or d 100, work a little differently.
        - You
        - generate a number between 1 and 100 by rolling two
        - different ten-sided dice num bered from 0 to 9.
        - One die
        - (designated before you roll) gives the tens digit, and
        - the other gives the ones digit.
        - If you roll a 7 and a 1, for
        - example, the number rolled is 71.
        - Two Os represent 100.
        - Som e ten-sided dice are numbered in tens (00, 10, 20,
        - and so on), making it easier to distinguish the tens digit
        - from the ones digit.
        - In this case, a roll of 70 and 1 is 71,
        - and 00 and 0 is 100.
        - W hen you need to roll dice, the rules tell you how
        - "many dice to roll o f a certain type, as well as what m od\xAD"
        - ifiers to add.
        - "For example, \u201C3d8 + 5 \u201D means you roll"
        - three eight-sided dice, add them together, and add 5
        - to the total.
        - "The sam e d notation appears in the expressions \u201C1d3\u201D"
        - "and \u201C1d2.\u201D To simulate the roll of 1d3, roll a d6 and"
        - divide the num ber rolled by 2 (round up).
        - To simulate
        - the roll of 1d2, roll any die and assign a 1 or 2 to the roll
        - depending on whether it w as odd or even. (Alternatively,
        - if the number rolled is m ore than half the number of
        - "sides on the die, it\u2019s a 2.)"
        - T h e D 2 0
        - "D oes an adventurer\u2019s sword swing hurt a dragon or just"
        - bounce off its iron-hard scales?
        - Will the ogre believe an
        - outrageous bluff?
        - Can a character swim across a raging
        - river?
        - Can a character avoid the main blast of a fireball,
        - or does he or she take full damage from the blaze?
        - In
        - cases w here the outcom e of an action is uncertain,
        - the D u n g e o n s & D r a g o n s game relies on rolls o f a
        - 20-sided die, a d20, to determine success or failure.
        - "Every character and monster in the game has capa\xAD"
        - bilities defined by six ability scores.
        - The abilities are
        - Strength, Dexterity, Constitution, Intelligence, W isdom,
        - and Charisma, and they typically range from 3 to 18
        - for m ost adventurers. (Monsters might have scores as
        - low as 1 or as high as 30.) These ability scores, and the
        - ability modifiers derived from them, are the basis for
        - "almost every d20 roll that a player m akes on a charac\xAD"
        - "ter\u2019s or monster\u2019s behalf."
        - Ability checks, attack rolls, and saving throws are the
        - three main kinds of d20 rolls, forming the core of the
        - rules of the game.
        - All three follow these simple steps.
        - '1.'
        - Roll the die and add a modifier.
        - Roll a d20 and
        - add the relevant modifier.
        - "This is typically the m od\xAD"
        - ifier derived from one of the six ability scores, and it
        - "som etim es includes a proficiency bonus to reflect a char\xAD"
        - "acter\u2019s particular skill. (See chapter 1 for details on each"
        - "ability and how to determine an ability\u2019s modifier.)"
        - '2.'
        - Apply circumstantial bonuses and penalties.
        - A
        - class feature, a spell, a particular circum stance, or som e
        - other effect might give a bonus or penalty to the check.
        - '3.'
        - Compare the total to a target number.
        - If the total
        - equals or exceeds the target number, the ability check,
        - attack roll, or saving throw is a success.
        - "Otherwise, it\u2019s"
        - a failure.
        - The DM is usually the one w ho determines
        - target numbers and tells players whether their ability
        - checks, attack rolls, and saving throws succeed or fail.
        - The target number for an ability check or a saving
        - throw is called a Difficulty Class (DC).
        - The target
        - number for an attack roll is called an Armor Class (AC).
        - This simple rule governs the resolution of m ost tasks
        - in D&D play.
        - Chapter 7 provides m ore detailed rules for
        - using the d20 in the game.

        - Som etim es an ability check, attack roll, or saving throw
        - is modified by special situations called advantage and
        - disadvantage.
        - "Advantage reflects the positive circum \xAD"
        - stances surrounding a d20 roll, while disadvantage
        - reflects the opposite.
        - W hen you have either advantage or
        - disadvantage, you roll a second d20 w hen you make the

        - OUR FIRST STEP IN PLAYING AN ADVENTURER IN THE
        - D u n g e o n s & D r a g o n s game is to imagine
        - and create a character of your own.
        - Your
        - character is a combination of game statistics,
        - roleplaying hooks, and your imagination.
        - You
        - choose a race (such as human or halfling) and
        - a class (such as fighter or wizard).
        - You also
        - invent the personality, appearance, and backstory of
        - your character.
        - Once completed, your character serves
        - as your representative in the game, your avatar in the
        - D u n g e o n s & D r a g o n s world.
        - Before you dive into step 1 below, think about the
        - kind o f adventurer you want to play.
        - You might be a
        - courageous fighter, a skulking rogue, a fervent cleric, or
        - a flamboyant wizard.
        - Or you might be m ore interested
        - in an unconventional character, such as a brawny rogue
        - who likes hand-to-hand combat, or a sharpshooter who
        - picks off enem ies from afar.
        - D o you like fantasy fiction
        - featuring dwarves or elves?
        - Try building a character of
        - one of those races.
        - D o you want your character to be the
        - toughest adventurer at the table?
        - Consider a class like
        - barbarian or paladin.
        - "If you don\u2019t know where else to"
        - begin, take a look at the illustrations in this book to see
        - what catches your interest.
        - Once you have a character in mind, follow these steps
        - in order, making decisions that reflect the character you
        - want.
        - Your conception of your character might evolve
        - with each choice you make.
        - "W hat\u2019s important is that you"
        - "com e to the table with a character you\u2019re excited to play."

        - end of this book), som e form of digital record, or a piece
        - of notebook paper.
        - An official D&D character sheet is a
        - fine place to start until you know what information you
        - need and how you use it during the game.
        - Each step o f character creation includes an example of
        - that step, with a player named Bob building his dwarf

        - The threats
        - they face are relatively minor, usually posing a danger to

        - Many spellcasters gain access to 3rd-level
        - spells at the start of this tier, crossing a new threshold of

        - threaten cities and kingdoms.
        - In the third tier (levels 11-16), characters have
        - reached a level of power that sets them high above
        - the ordinary populace and makes them special even
        - am ong adventurers.
        - At 11th level, many spellcasters
        - gain access to 6th-level spells, som e of which create

        - At the fourth tier (levels 17-20), characters achieve
        - the pinnacle of their class features, becom ing heroic (or

        - Their spells, then, are

        - about the proper relationship of these spirits to each other

        - believe that arcane magic is an abomination against nature,
        - the Children of Winter venerate the forces of death, and the

        - The details in this chapter make a big difference in setting
        - your character apart from every other character.
        - Consider the
        - following two human fighters.
        - Hailing from the Dragonlance setting, Tika Waylan was a
        - brash teenager who had a rough childhood.
        - The daughter of
        - "a thief, she ran away from home and practiced her father\u2019s"
        - trade on the streets of Solace.
        - When she tried to rob the
        - proprietor of the Inn of the Last Home, he caught her and
        - took her under his wing, giving her a job as a barmaid.
        - But
        - when the dragonarmies laid waste to the town of Solace
        - and destroyed the inn, necessity forced Tika into adventure
        - "alongside the friends she\u2019d known from her childhood."
        - Her
        - skill as a fighter (a frying pan remains one of her favorite
        - weapons) combined with her history on the streets gave her
        - skills invaluable in her adventuring career.
        - Artemis Entreri grew up on the streets of Calimport in the
        - Forgotten Realms.
        - He used his wits, strength, and agility
        - to carve out his own territory in one of the city's hundreds
        - of poor shanty towns.
        - After several years, he attracted the
        - "notice of one of the most powerful thieves\u2019 guilds in the city,"
        - and he ascended the ranks of the guild quickly despite his
        - youth.
        - Artemis became the favored assassin of one of the
        - "city\u2019s pashas, who sent him to far-off Icewind Dale to recover"
        - some stolen gems.
        - "He\u2019s a professional killer, constantly"
        - challenging himself to improve his skills.
        - Tika and Artemis are both human and both fighters (with
        - some experience as rogues), possessing similarly high
        - Strength and Dexterity scores, but there the similarity ends.
        - "You don\u2019t need to be confined to binary notions of"
        - sex and gender.
        - The elf god Corellon Larethian is often
        - seen as androgynous or hermaphroditic, for example,
        - "and som e elves in the multiverse are made in Corellon\u2019s"
        - image.
        - You could also play a female character who
        - presents herself as a man, a man w ho feels trapped in a
        - female body, or a bearded female dwarf who hates being
        - mistaken for a male.
        - "Likewise, your character\u2019s sexual"
        - orientation is for you to decide.

        - its moral and personal attitudes.
        - Alignment is a

        - (good, evil, or neutral), and the other describes
        - attitudes toward society and order (lawful, chaotic,

        - Neutral good (NG) folk do the best they can to help
        - others according to their needs.

        - cloud giants, and most gnom es are neutral good.
        - Chaotic good (CG) creatures act as their conscience
        - directs, with little regard for what others expect.
        - Copper
        - dragons, many elves, and unicorns are chaotic good.
        - Lawful neutral (LN) individuals act in accordance
        - with law, tradition, or personal codes.
        - Many m onks and
        - som e w izards are lawful neutral.
        - Neutral (N) is the alignment of those w ho prefer to

        - The three most com m on coins are the gold
        - piece (gp), the silver piece (sp), and the copper piece (cp).
        - With one gold piece, a character can buy a belt

        - A skilled (but
        - not exceptional) artisan can earn one gold piece a day.

        - wealth, even if the coin itself is not com m only used.

        - services worth hundreds or thousands of gold pieces,
        - "the transactions don\u2019t usually involve the exchange of"

        - Rather, the gold piece is a standard
        - m easure of value, and the actual exchange is in gold
        - bars, letters of credit, or valuable goods.
        - One gold piece is w orth ten silver pieces, the most
        - prevalent coin among com m oners.
        - A silver piece buys a

        - rest in a poor inn.
        - One silver piece is worth ten copper pieces, which are
        - com m on am ong laborers and beggars.
        - A single copper
        - piece buys a candle, a torch, or a piece of chalk.

        - trade them in for coin or use them as currency for other

        - A r m o r a n d Sh ie l d s
        - D&D worlds are a vast tapestry made up of many
        - different cultures, each with its own technology level.
        - For this reason, adventurers have access to a variety
        - of armor types, ranging from leather armor to chain
        - mail to costly plate armor, with several other kinds of
        - armor in between.
        - The Arm or table collects the most
        - com m only available types of armor found in the game
        - 'and separates them into three categories: light armor,'
        - medium armor, and heavy armor.
        - Many warriors
        - supplement their armor with a shield.
        - 'V a r i a n t : E q u i p m e n t S i z e s'
        - In most campaigns, you can use or wear any equipment that
        - you find on your adventures, within the bounds of common
        - sense.
        - "For example, a burly half-orc won't fit in a halfling\u2019s"
        - leather armor, and a gnome would be swallowed up in a
        - "cloud giant\u2019s elegant robe."
        - The DM can impose more realism.
        - For example, a suit of
        - plate armor made for one human might not fit another one
        - "without significant alterations, and a guard\u2019s uniform might"
        - be visibly ill-fitting when an adventurer tries to wear it as a
        - disguise.
        - Using this variant, when adventurers find armor, clothing,
        - and similar items that are made to be worn, they might need
        - to visit an armorsmith, tailor, leatherworker, or similar expert
        - to make the item wearable.
        - The cost for such work varies
        - from 10 to 40 percent of the market price of the item.
        - The
        - DM can either roll 1d4 x 10 or determine the increase in cost
        - based on the extent of the alterations required.
        - The Arm or table shows the cost, weight, and other
        - properties of the com m on types of armor worn in the
        - worlds of D&D.
        - Armor Proficiency.
        - Anyone can put on a suit o f armor
        - or strap a shield to an arm.
        - Only those proficient in the

        - throw, or attack roll that involves Strength or Dexterity,

        - Shields.
        - A shield is made from w ood or metal and

        - Many weapons have special properties related to their use,

        - Ammunition.
        - You can use a weapon that has the
        - ammunition property to make a ranged attack only if
        - you have ammunition to fire from the weapon.
        - Each

        - The W eapons table shows the most com m on weapons
        - used in the worlds of D&D, their price and weight,
        - the damage they deal when they hit, and any special
        - properties they possess.
        - Every weapon is classified
        - as either melee or ranged.
        - A melee weapon is used to
        - attack a target within 5 feet of you, whereas a ranged
        - weapon is used to attack a target at a distance.
        - If you use a weapon that has the ammunition property
        - to make a melee attack, you treat the weapon as an
        - improvised weapon (see "Improvised Weapons" later in
        - the section).
        - A sling must be loaded to deal any damage
        - when used in this way.
        - Finesse.
        - When making an attack with a finesse
        - weapon, you use your choice o f your Strength or
        - Dexterity modifier for the attack and damage rolls.
        - You
        - must use the same m odifier for both rolls.
        - Heavy.
        - Sm all creatures have disadvantage on attack
        - rolls with heavy weapons.
        - "A heavy w eapon\u2019s size and"
        - bulk make it too large for a Sm all creature to use
        - effectively.
        - Light.
        - A light weapon is small and easy to handle,
        - making it ideal for use when fighting with two weapons.
        - See the rules for two-weapon fighting in chapter 9.
        - Loading.
        - Because of the time required to load this
        - weapon, you can fire only one piece of ammunition
        - from it when you use an action, bonus action, or reaction
        - to fire it, regardless of the number of attacks you can
        - normally make.
        - Range.
        - A weapon that can be used to make a ranged
        - attack has a range shown in parentheses after the
        - ammunition or thrown property.
        - The range lists two
        - numbers.
        - "The first is the w eapon\u2019s normal range in feet,"
        - "and the second indicates the w eapon\u2019s maximum range."
        - W hen attacking a target beyond normal range, you have
        - disadvantage on the attack roll.
        - "You can\u2019t attack a target"
        - "beyond the w eapon\u2019s long range."
        - Reach.
        - This w eapon adds 5 feet to your reach when
        - you attack with it.
        - Special.
        - A w eapon with the special property has
        - unusual rules governing its use, explained in the
        - "w eapon\u2019s description (see \"Special W eapons\" later in"
        - this section).
        - Thrown.
        - If a weapon has the thrown property, you
        - can throw the w eapon to make a ranged attack.
        - If the
        - weapon is a melee weapon, you use the same ability
        - m odifier for that attack roll and damage roll that you
        - would use for a melee attack with the weapon.
        - For
        - example, if you throw a handaxe, you use your Strength,
        - but if you throw a dagger, you can use either your
        - Strength or your Dexterity, since the dagger has the
        - finesse property.
        - Two-Handed.
        - This w eapon requires two hands to use.
        - Versatile.
        - This weapon can be used with one or two

        - A good mount can help you move m ore quickly through
        - the w ilderness, but its primary purpose is to carry the
        - gear that w ould otherwise slow you down.
        - The Mounts
        - "and Other Anim als table shows each animal\u2019s speed and"
        - base carrying capacity.
        - An animal pulling a carriage, cart, chariot, sled,
        - or wagon can move weight up to five times its base
        - carrying capacity, including the weight of the vehicle.
        - If multiple animals pull the same vehicle, they can add
        - their carrying capacity together.
        - Mounts other than those listed here are available in
        - the worlds of D&D, but they are rare and not normally
        - available for purchase.
        - These include flying mounts
        - (pegasi, griffons, hippogriffs, and similar animals) and
        - even aquatic mounts (giant sea horses, for example).
        - Acquiring such a mount often means securing an egg
        - and raising the creature yourself, making a bargain with
        - a powerful entity, or negotiating with the mount itself.
        - Barding.
        - Barding is arm or designed to protect an
        - "anim al\u2019s head, neck, chest, and body."
        - Any type of
        - arm or shown on the Arm or table in this chapter can
        - be purchased as barding.
        - The cost is four times the
        - equivalent armor made for humanoids, and it weighs
        - tw ice as much.
        - Saddles.
        - A military saddle braces the rider, helping
        - you keep your seat on an active mount in battle.
        - It
        - gives you advantage on any check you make to remain
        - mounted.
        - An exotic saddle is required for riding any
        - aquatic or flying mount.
        - Vehicle Proficiency.
        - If you have proficiency with a
        - certain kind of vehicle (land or water), you can add your
        - proficiency bonus to any check you make to control that
        - kind of vehicle in difficult circum stances.
        - Rowed Vessels.
        - Keelboats and rowboats are used on
        - lakes and rivers.
        - If going downstream, add the speed of
        - the current (typically 3 m iles per hour) to the speed of
        - the vehicle.
        - "These vehicles can\u2019t be rowed against any"
        - significant current, but they can be pulled upstream
        - by draft animals on the shores.
        - A rowboat weighs 100
        - pounds, in case adventurers carry it over land.

        - the personal details you create set your
        - character apart from every other character.
        - Even within your class and race, you have

        - "DM \u2019s perm ission\u2014want to go a step further."
        - This chapter defines two optional sets of rules for
        - 'customizing your character: multiclassing and feats.'
        - Multiclassing lets you com bine classes together,
        - and feats are special options you can choose instead
        - of increasing your ability scores as you gain levels.
        - Your DM decides whether these options are available
        - in a campaign.
        - M u l t ic l a s s in g
        - Multiclassing allows you to gain levels in multiple
        - classes.
        - Doing so lets you m ix the abilities of those
        - classes to realize a character concept that might not be
        - reflected in one of the standard class options.
        - With this rule, you have the option of gaining a level
        - in a new class whenever you advance in level, instead
        - of gaining a level in your current class.
        - Your levels in
        - all your classes are added together to determine your
        - character level.
        - For example, if you have three levels in
        - "wizard and two in fighter, you\u2019re a 5th-level character."
        - As you advance in levels, you might primarily remain
        - a m em ber of your original class with just a few levels
        - in another class, or you might change course entirely,
        - never looking back at the class you left behind.
        - You
        - might even start progressing in a third or fourth class.
        - Com pared to a single-class character of the sam e level,
        - "you\u2019ll sacrifice som e focus in exchange for versatility."
        - Gary is playing a 4th-level fighter.
        - When his character earns
        - enough experience points to reach 5th level, Gary decides
        - that his character will multiclass instead of continuing to
        - progress as a fighter.
        - "Gary\u2019s fighter has been spending a lot"
        - "of time with Dave\u2019s rogue, and has even been doing some"
        - "jobs on the side for the local thieves\u2019 guild as a bruiser."
        - Gary
        - decides that his character will multiclass into the rogue class,
        - and thus his character becomes a 4th-level fighter and 1st-
        - level rogue (written as fighter 4/rogue 1).
        - "When Gary\u2019s character earns enough experience to"
        - reach 6th level, he can decide whether to add another
        - fighter level (becoming a fighter 5/rogue 1), another rogue
        - level (becoming a fighter 4/rogue 2), or a level in a third
        - class, perhaps dabbling in wizardry thanks to the tome of
        - mysterious lore he acquired (becoming a fighter 4/rogue 1/
        - wizard 1).

        - Your capacity for spellcasting depends partly on your
        - com bined levels in all your spellcasting classes and
        - partly on your individual levels in those classes.
        - Once
        - you have the Spellcasting feature from m ore than one
        - class, use the rules below.
        - If you multiclass but have the
        - Spellcasting feature from only one class, you follow the
        - rules as described in that class.
        - Spells Known and Prepared.
        - You determine
        - what spells you know and can prepare for each class
        - individually, as if you were a single-classed mem ber of
        - that class.
        - If you are a ranger 4/wizard 3, for example,
        - you know three 1st-level ranger spells based on your
        - levels in the ranger class.
        - As 3rd-level wizard, you know
        - three w izard cantrips, and your spellbook contains ten
        - wizard spells, two of which (the two you gained when
        - you reached 3rd level as a wizard) can be 2nd-level
        - spells.
        - If your Intelligence is 16, you can prepare six
        - wizard spells from your spellbook.
        - Each spell you know and prepare is associated with one
        - of your classes, and you use the spellcasting ability of that
        - class when you cast the spell.
        - Similarly, a spellcasting
        - focus, such as a holy symbol, can be used only for the
        - spells from the class associated with that focus.
        - Spell Slots.
        - You determine your available spell slots
        - by adding together all your levels in the bard, cleric,
        - druid, sorcerer, and wizard classes, half your levels
        - (rounded down) in the paladin and ranger classes, and
        - a third o f your fighter or rogue levels (rounded down)
        - if you have the Eldritch Knight or the Arcane Trickster
        - feature.
        - Use this total to determine your spell slots by
        - consulting the Multiclass Spellcaster table.
        - If you have m ore than one spellcasting class, this table
        - might give you spell slots of a level that is higher than
        - the spells you know or can prepare.
        - You can use those
        - slots, but only to cast your lower-level spells.
        - If a lower-
        - level spell that you cast, like burning hands, has an
        - enhanced effect when cast using a higher-level slot, you
        - "can use the enhanced effect, even though you don\u2019t have"
        - any spells of that higher level.
        - For example, if you are the aforementioned ranger 4/
        - wizard 3, you count as a 5th-level character when
        - 'determining your spell slots: you have four 1st-level'
        - slots, three 2nd-level slots, and two 3rd-level slots.
        - "However, you don\u2019t know any 3rd-level spells, nor do you"
        - know any 2nd-level ranger spells.
        - You can use the spell
        - "slots of those levels to cast the spells you do know\u2014and"
        - potentially enhance their effects.
        - Pact Magic.
        - If you have both the Spellcasting class
        - feature and the Pact Magic class feature from the warlock
        - class, you can use the spell slots you gain from the Pact
        - Magic feature to cast spells you know or have prepared
        - from classes with the Spellcasting class feature, and you
        - can use the spell slots you gain from the Spellcasting
        - class feature to cast w arlock spells you know.

        - This chapter focuses on how to use ability checks

        - Rules for attack rolls

        - "Each of a creature\u2019s abilities has a score, a number that"
        - defines the magnitude of that ability.
        - An ability score
        - is not just a measure of innate capabilities, but also
        - "encom passes a creature\u2019s training and com petence in"
        - activities related to that ability.
        - A score of 10 or 11 is the normal human average, but
        - adventurers and many monsters are a cut above average
        - in most abilities.
        - A score of 18 is the highest that a
        - person usually reaches.
        - Adventurers can have scores
        - as high as 20, and monsters and divine beings can have
        - scores as high as 30.
        - Each ability also has a modifier, derived from the
        - score and ranging from 5 (for an ability score of 1) to
        - +10 (for a score of 30).
        - The Ability Scores and M odifiers

        - the table, subtract 10 from the ability score and then
        - divide the total by 2 (round down).

        - Som etim es a special ability or spell tells you that you
        - have advantage or disadvantage on an ability check,
        - a saving throw, or an attack roll.
        - W hen that happens,
        - you roll a second d20 when you make the roll.
        - Use the
        - higher of the two rolls if you have advantage, and use
        - the lower roll if you have disadvantage.
        - For example, if
        - you have disadvantage and roll a 17 and a 5, you use the
        - '5.'
        - If you instead have advantage and roll those numbers,
        - you use the 17.
        - If multiple situations affect a roll and each one grants
        - "advantage or im poses disadvantage on it, you don\u2019t roll"
        - m ore than one additional d20.
        - If two favorable situations
        - grant advantage, for example, you still roll only one
        - additional d20.
        - If circum stances cause a roll to have both advantage
        - and disadvantage, you are considered to have neither of
        - them, and you roll one d20.
        - This is true even if multiple
        - circum stances im pose disadvantage and only one grants
        - advantage or vice versa.
        - In such a situation, you have
        - neither advantage nor disadvantage.
        - W hen you have advantage or disadvantage and
        - "som ething in the game, such as the halfling\u2019s Lucky"
        - trait, lets you reroll the d20, you can reroll only one
        - of the dice.
        - You choose which one.
        - For example, if a
        - halfling has advantage on an ability check and rolls
        - a 1 and a 13, the halfling could use the Lucky trait to
        - reroll the 1.
        - You usually gain advantage or disadvantage through
        - the use of special abilities, actions, or spells.
        - Inspiration
        - (see chapter 4) can also give a character advantage on
        - "checks related to the character\u2019s personality, ideals,"
        - or bonds.
        - The DM can also decide that circum stances
        - influence a roll in one direction or the other and grant
        - advantage or im pose disadvantage as a result.
        - P r o f ic ie n c y B o n u s
        - Characters have a proficiency bonus determined by
        - level, as detailed in chapter 1.
        - Monsters also have this
        - bonus, which is incorporated in their stat blocks.
        - The
        - bonus is used in the rules on ability checks, saving
        - throws, and attack rolls.
        - "Your proficiency bonus can\u2019t be added to a single die"
        - roll or other number m ore than once.
        - For example, if
        - two different rules say you can add your proficiency
        - bonus to a W isdom saving throw, you nevertheless add
        - the bonus only once when you make the save.
        - Occasionally, your proficiency bonus might be
        - multiplied or divided (doubled or halved, for example)
        - before you apply it.
        - For example, the rogue's Expertise
        - feature doubles the proficiency bonus for certain ability
        - checks.
        - If a circum stance suggests that your proficiency
        - bonus applies m ore than once to the sam e roll, you still
        - add it only once and multiply or divide it only once.
        - By the sam e token, if a feature or effect allows you
        - to multiply your proficiency bonus when making an
        - "ability check that w ouldn\u2019t normally benefit from your"
        - "proficiency bonus, you still don\u2019t add the bonus to the"
        - check.
        - For that check your proficiency bonus is 0, given
        - the fact that multiplying 0 by any number is still 0.
        - For
        - instance, if you lack proficiency in the History skill,
        - you gain no benefit from a feature that lets you double
        - your proficiency bonus when you make Intelligence
        - (History) checks.
        - "In general, you don\u2019t multiply your proficiency bonus"
        - for attack rolls or saving throws.
        - If a feature or effect
        - allows you to do so, these same rules apply.

        - "one from accom plishing a goal\u2014for example, when a"
        - monster tries to force open a door that an adventurer
        - is holding closed.
        - In situations like these, the outcome
        - is determined by a special form of ability check,
        - called a contest.
        - Both participants in a contest make ability checks
        - appropriate to their efforts.
        - They apply all appropriate
        - bonuses and penalties, but instead o f com paring the
        - total to a DC, they com pare the totals of their two
        - checks.
        - The participant with the higher check total wins
        - the contest.
        - That character or monster either succeeds
        - at the action or prevents the other one from succeeding.
        - If the contest results in a tie, the situation remains the
        - same as it was before the contest.
        - Thus, one contestant
        - might win the contest by default.
        - If two characters tie in
        - a contest to snatch a ring off the floor, neither character
        - grabs it.
        - In a contest between a monster trying to open
        - a door and an adventurer trying to keep the door closed,
        - a tie means that the door remains shut.
        - Sk i l l s
        - Each ability covers a broad range of capabilities,
        - including skills that a character or a monster can be
        - proficient in.
        - A skill represents a specific aspect of an

        - "demonstrates a focus on that aspect. (A character\u2019s"

        - "creation, and a monster\u2019s skill proficiencies appear in"
        - "the monster\u2019s stat block.)"
        - For example, a Dexterity check might reflect a
        - "character\u2019s attempt to pull off an acrobatic stunt, to palm"
        - an object, or to stay hidden.
        - Each of these aspects of

        - S o a character w ho has

        - "(Perception) check.\u201D At other times, a player might ask"
        - the DM if proficiency in a particular skill applies to a

        - In either case, proficiency in a skill means an
        - individual can add his or her proficiency bonus to ability
        - checks that involve that skill.

        - For example, if a character attempts to clim b up a
        - dangerous cliff, the Dungeon Master might ask for a
        - Strength (Athletics) check.
        - If the character is proficient
        - "in Athletics, the character\u2019s proficiency bonus is added"
        - to the Strength check.
        - If the character lacks that
        - proficiency, he or she just makes a Strength check.
        - 'V a r i a n t : S k i l l s w i t h D i f f e r e n t A b i l i t i e s'
        - Normally, your proficiency in a skill applies only to a
        - specific kind of ability check.
        - Proficiency in Athletics,
        - for example, usually applies to Strength checks.
        - In som e
        - situations, though, your proficiency might reasonably
        - apply to a different kind of check.
        - In such cases, the DM
        - might ask for a check using an unusual combination of
        - ability and skill, or you might ask your DM if you can
        - apply a proficiency to a different check.
        - For example,
        - if you have to swim from an offshore island to the
        - mainland, your DM might call for a Constitution check
        - to see if you have the stamina to make it that far.
        - In this
        - case, your DM might allow you to apply your proficiency
        - in Athletics and ask for a Constitution (Athletics) check.
        - "S o if you\u2019re proficient in Athletics, you apply your"
        - proficiency bonus to the Constitution check just as you
        - would normally do for a Strength (Athletics) check.
        - Similarly, when your half-orc barbarian uses a display
        - of raw strength to intimidate an enemy, your DM might
        - ask for a Strength (Intimidation) check, even though
        - Intimidation is normally associated with Charisma.
        - Pa s s iv e C h e c k s
        - A passive check is a special kind of ability check that
        - "doesn\u2019t involve any die rolls."
        - Such a check can represent
        - the average result for a task done repeatedly, such as
        - searching for secret doors over and over again, or can
        - be used when the DM wants to secretly determine
        - whether the characters succeed at som ething without
        - rolling dice, such as noticing a hidden monster.
        - "Here\u2019s how to determine a character\u2019s total for a"
        - 'passive check:'
        - 10 + all modifiers that normally apply to the check
        - If the character has advantage on the check, add 5.
        - For
        - disadvantage, subtract 5.
        - The game refers to a passive
        - check total as a score.
        - For example, if a 1st-level character has a W isdom of
        - 15 and proficiency in Perception, he or she has a passive
        - W isdom (Perception) score of 14.
        - "The rules on hiding in the \u201CDexterity\u201D section below"
        - rely on passive checks, as do the exploration rules
        - in chapter 8.

        - tricky social situation.
        - The Deception, Intimidation,

        - certain kinds of Charisma checks.
        - Deception.
        - Your Charisma (Deception) check
        - determines whether you can convincingly hide the
        - truth, either verbally or through your actions.
        - This
        - deception can encom pass everything from misleading
        - others through ambiguity to telling outright lies.
        - Typical
        - situations include trying to fast-talk a guard, con a
        - merchant, earn money through gambling, pass yourself
        - "off in a disguise, dull som eone\u2019s suspicions with false"
        - assurances, or maintain a straight face while telling
        - a blatant lie.
        - Intimidation.
        - W hen you attempt to influence som eone
        - through overt threats, hostile actions, and physical
        - violence, the DM might ask you to make a Charisma
        - (Intimidation) check.
        - Examples include trying to pry
        - information out of a prisoner, convincing street thugs
        - to back down from a confrontation, or using the edge of
        - a broken bottle to convince a sneering vizier to
        - reconsider a decision.
        - Performance.
        - Your Charisma (Perform ance) check
        - determines how well you can delight an audience with
        - music, dance, acting, storytelling, or som e other form of
        - entertainment.
        - Persuasion.
        - W hen you attempt to influence som eone
        - or a group o f people with tact, social graces, or good
        - nature, the DM might ask you to make a Charisma
        - (Persuasion) check.
        - Typically, you use persuasion when
        - acting in good faith, to foster friendships, make cordial
        - requests, or exhibit proper etiquette.
        - Examples of
        - persuading others include convincing a chamberlain to
        - let your party see the king, negotiating peace between
        - warring tribes, or inspiring a crowd of townsfolk.
        - Other Charisma Checks.

        - appropriate ability modifier.
        - For example, you use your

        - A saving throw can be modified by a situational

        - and disadvantage, as determined by the DM.
        - Each class gives proficiency in at least two saving

        - a particular ability score.
        - Som e monsters have saving
        - throw proficiencies as well.
        - The Difficulty Class for a saving throw is determined
        - by the effect that causes it.

        - The result of a successful or failed saving throw is
        - also detailed in the effect that allows the save.
        - Usually,
        - a successful save m eans that a creature suffers no

        - And if all goes well, your
        - character will survive to claim rich rewards before
        - embarking on a new adventure.
        - This chapter covers the basics of the adventuring life,

        - "The DM \u2019s notes, including a key to the map, describe"

        - instead of a map.
        - T im e
        - In situations where keeping track of the passage of
        - time is important, the DM determines the time a task
        - requires.
        - The DM might use a different time scale
        - depending on the context of the situation at hand.
        - In
        - "a dungeon environment, the adventurers\u2019 movement"
        - happens on a scale of minutes.
        - It takes them about a
        - minute to creep down a long hallway, another minute
        - to check for traps on the door at the end of the hall, and
        - a good ten minutes to search the cham ber beyond for
        - anything interesting or valuable.
        - In a city or wilderness, a scale of hours is often more
        - appropriate.
        - Adventurers eager to reach the lonely tower
        - at the heart of the forest hurry across those fifteen miles
        - "in just under four hours\u2019 time."
        - For long journeys, a scale of days works best.

        - adventurers spend four uneventful days before a goblin
        - ambush interrupts their journey.
        - In combat and other fast-paced situations, the game

        - in chapter 9.

        - normal, fast, or slow pace, as shown on the Travel Pace
        - table.

        - period of time and whether the pace has any effect.
        - A
        - fast pace m akes characters less perceptive, while a slow
        - pace makes it possible to sneak around and to search an

        - characters travel for 8 hours in day.
        - They can push on
        - beyond that limit, at the risk of exhaustion.
        - For each additional hour of travel beyond 8 hours,
        - the characters cover the distance shown in the Hour
        - colum n for their pace, and each character must make
        - a Constitution saving throw at the end of the hour.
        - The
        - DC is 10 + 1 for each hour past 8 hours.
        - On a failed
        - saving throw, a character suffers one level of exhaustion
        - (see appendix A).
        - Mounts and Vehicles.
        - For short spans of time (up
        - to an hour), many animals move much faster than
        - humanoids.
        - A mounted character can ride at a gallop
        - for about an hour, covering twice the usual distance for
        - a fast pace.
        - If fresh mounts are available every 8 to 10
        - miles, characters can cover larger distances at this pace,
        - but this is very rare except in densely populated areas.
        - Characters in wagons, carriages, or other land
        - vehicles choose a pace as normal.
        - Characters in a
        - waterborne vessel are limited to the speed of the vessel
        - "(see chapter 5), and they don\u2019t suffer penalties for a fast"
        - pace or gain benefits from a slow pace.
        - Depending on
        - the vessel and the size of the crew, ships might be able
        - to travel for up to 24 hours per day.
        - Certain special mounts, such as a pegasus or griffon,
        - or special vehicles, such as a carpet of flying, allow you

        - Speed.
        - Rather than moving foot by foot, move square by

        - entering it.

        - This chapter provides the rules for
        - casting spells.
        - Different character
        - classes have distinctive ways of learning
        - and preparing their spells, and monsters
        - use spells in unique ways.
        - Regardless of its source,
        - a spell follows the rules here.
        - W h a t I s a Spell?
        - A spell is a discrete magical effect, a single shaping
        - of the magical energies that suffuse the multiverse
        - into a specific, limited expression.
        - In casting a spell,
        - a character carefully plucks at the invisible strands of
        - raw m agic suffusing the world, pins them in place in a
        - particular pattern, sets them vibrating in a specific way,
        - "and then releases them to unleash the desired effect\u2014in"
        - most cases, all in the span o f seconds.
        - Spells can be versatile tools, weapons, or protective
        - wards.
        - They can deal damage or undo it, im pose or
        - remove conditions (see appendix A), drain life energy
        - away, and restore life to the dead.
        - Uncounted thousands of spells have been created
        - "over the course of the multiverse\u2019s history, and many of"
        - them are long forgotten.
        - Som e might yet lie recorded in
        - crumbling spellbooks hidden in ancient ruins or trapped
        - in the minds of dead gods.
        - Or they might som eday be
        - reinvented by a character who has am assed enough
        - power and w isdom to do so.
        - Every spell has a level from 0 to 9.
        - "A spell\u2019s level is a"
        - general indicator of how powerful it is, with the lowly
        - (but still impressive) magic missile at 1st level and

        - spellcaster must be to use that spell.
        - "Spell level and character level don\u2019t correspond"
        - directly.
        - Typically, a character has to be at least 17th
        - level, not 9th level, to cast a 9th-level spell.

        - M embers o f a few classes,

        - the 3rd-level wizard Umara has four 1st-level spell slots
        - and two 2nd-level slots.
        - W hen a character casts a spell, he or she expends
        - "a slot of that spell\u2019s level or higher, effectively \u201Cfilling\u201D"
        - a slot with the spell.
        - You can think of a spell slot as a
        - "groove of a certain size\u2014small for a 1st-level slot, larger"
        - for a spell of higher level.
        - A 1st-level spell fits into a slot
        - of any size, but a 9th-level spell fits only in a 9th-level
        - slot.
        - S o when Umara casts magic missile, a 1st-level
        - spell, she spends one of her four 1st-level slots and has
        - three remaining.
        - Finishing a long rest restores any expended spell slots
        - (see chapter 8 for the rules on resting).
        - Som e characters and m onsters have special abilities
        - that let them cast spells without using spell slots.
        - For
        - example, a m onk who follows the Way o f the Four
        - Elements, a warlock who chooses certain eldritch
        - invocations, and a pit fiend from the Nine Hells can all

        - inaccessible;the most powerful archmage can't light a candle

        - surrounded by the Weave, a spellcaster can shape lightning
        - to blast foes, transport hundreds of miles in the blink of an
        - eye, or even reverse death itself.
        - All magic depends on the Weave, though different kinds
        - of magic access it in a variety of ways.
        - The spells of wizards,
        - warlocks, sorcerers, and bards are commonly called arcane
        - magic.
        - "These spells rely on an understanding\u2014 learned or"
        - "intuitive\u2014 of the workings of the Weave."
        - The caster plucks
        - directly at the strands of the Weave to create the desired
        - effect.
        - Eldritch knights and arcane tricksters also use arcane
        - magic.
        - The spells of clerics, druids, paladins, and rangers are
        - called divine magic.
        - "These spellcasters\u2019 access to the Weave"
        - "is mediated by divine power\u2014 gods, the divine forces of"
        - "nature, or the sacred weight of a paladin\u2019s oath."
        - Whenever a magic effect is created, the threads of the
        - Weave intertwine, twist, and fold to make the effect possible.
        - When characters use divination spells such as detect magic or
        - identify, they glimpse the Weave.
        - A spell such as dispel magic
        - smooths the Weave.
        - Spells such as antimagic field rearrange
        - the Weave so that magic flows around, rather than through,
        - the area affected by the spell.
        - And in places where the Weave
        - "is damaged or torn, magic works in unpredictable ways\u2014 or"
        - not at all.

        - and so on around the points of the com pass.

        - The DM has great latitude in
        - ruling what occurs in such an instance; the greater the
        - wish, the greater the likelihood that som ething goes
        - wrong.
        - This spell might simply fail, the effect you desire
        - might only be partly achieved, or you might suffer som e
        - unforeseen consequence as a result of how you worded
        - the wish.
        - For example, wishing that a villain w ere dead
        - might propel you forward in time to a period when that
        - villain is no longer alive, effectively removing you from
        - the game.
        - Similarly, wishing for a legendary magic item
        - or artifact might instantly transport you to the presence
        - "of the item\u2019s current owner."
        - The stress of casting this spell to produce any effect
        - other than duplicating another spell w eakens you.
        - After
        - enduring that stress, each time you cast a spell until
        - you finish a long rest, you take 1d10 necrotic damage
        - per level of that spell.
        - "This damage can\u2019t be reduced or"

        - In addition, your Strength drops
        - "to 3, if it isn\u2019t 3 or lower already, for 2d4 days."
        - For each
        - of those days that you spend resting and doing nothing
        - m ore than light activity, your remaining recovery time
        - decreases by 2 days.
        - Finally, there is a 33 percent
        - chance that you are unable to cast wish ever again if you
        - suffer this stress.

        - As described in
        - the chapter 3, though, the Life domain is incredibly broad,
        - and a cleric of any non-evil deity can choose it.
        - A number of other deities, mostly evil ones, suggest the
        - "Death domain, which is detailed in the Dungeon Master\u2019s"

        - Most clerics who choose this domain are evil NPCs,

        - the Sovereign Host and their malign shadow, the Dark
        - Six.
        - The gods of the Sovereign Host are thought to have
        - dom inion over every aspect of existence, and to speak
        - with a unified voice.
        - But the Dark Six are the primitive,

        - The monotheistic Church
        - of the Silver Flame is devoted to fighting against evil in
        - the world, but plagued by corruption in its own ranks.
        - The philosophy of the Blood of Vol teaches that divinity
        - lies within all mortal beings and reveres the undead
        - who have secured that immortality.
        - Various mad cults
        - are devoted to the dem ons and horrors imprisoned
        - in Eberron's Underdark (called Khyber, the Dragon
        - Below).

        - And two related nations of elves revere their
        - 'ancestral spirits: the Undying Court, preserved as'

        - of the Past, the great heroes of ancient wars.

        - Nonhuman races often have whole pantheons of

        - The Celtic, Egyptian, Greek, and Norse pantheons are
        - fantasy interpretations of historical religions from our
        - "w orld\u2019s ancient times."
        - They include deities that are
        - most appropriate for use in a D&D game, divorced from
        - their historical context in the real world and united into
        - pantheons that serve the needs of the game.
        - T h e C e l t ic Pa n t h e o n
        - "It\u2019s said that som ething wild lurks in the heart of every"
        - soul, a space that thrills to the sound of geese calling
        - at night, to the whispering wind through the pines, to
        - "the unexpected red of mistletoe on an oak\u2014and it is in"
        - this space that the Celtic gods dwell.
        - They sprang from
        - the brook and stream, their might heightened by the
        - strength of the oak and the beauty of the woodlands and
        - open moor.
        - W hen the first forester dared put a name to
        - the face seen in the bole of a tree or the voice babbling
        - in a brook, these gods forced themselves into being.
        - The Celtic gods are as often served by druids as by
        - clerics, for they are closely aligned with the forces of
        - nature that druids revere.
        - T h e G r e e k Pa n t h e o n
        - The gods of Olympus make themselves known with the
        - gentle lap of waves against the shores and the crash of
        - the thunder am ong the cloud-enshrouded peaks.
        - The
        - thick boar-infested w oods and the sere, olive-covered
        - hillsides hold evidence of their passing.
        - Every aspect
        - "of nature echoes with their presence, and they\u2019ve made"
        - a place for themselves inside the human heart, too.
        - T h e E g y p t i a n Pa n t h e o n
        - These gods are a young dynasty of an ancient divine
        - family, heirs to the rulership of the cosm os and the
        - "maintenance of the divine principle of Ma\u2019at\u2014the"
        - fundamental order of truth, justice, law, and order that
        - puts gods, mortal pharaohs, and ordinary men and
        - w om en in their logical and rightful place in the universe.
        - The Egyptian pantheon is unusual in having three
        - gods with the Death dom ain o f different alignments.
        - Anubis is the lawful neutral god of the afterlife, who
        - Fa n t a s y - H is t o r ic a l Pa n t h e o n s
        - judges the souls of the dead.
        - Set is a chaotic evil god
        - of murder, perhaps best known for killing his brother
        - Osiris.
        - And Nephthys is a chaotic good goddess of
        - mourning.
        - Thus, although m ost clerics of the Death
        - domain (found in the Dungeon Master's Guide) are
        - villainous characters, clerics w ho serve Anubis or
        - Nephthys need not be.
        - T h e N o r s e Pa n t h e o n
        - W here the land plummets from the snowy hills into the
        - icy fjords below, where the longboats draw up on to the
        - beach, where the glaciers flow forward and retreat with
        - "every fall and spring\u2014this is the land of the Vikings,"
        - the hom e of the Norse pantheon.
        - "It\u2019s a brutal clime,"
        - and one that calls for brutal living.
        - The w arriors of
        - the land have had to adapt to the harsh conditions in
        - "order to survive, but they haven\u2019t been too twisted by"
        - the needs of their environment.
        - Given the necessity of
        - "raiding for food and wealth, it\u2019s surprising the mortals"
        - turned out as well as they did.
        - Their powers reflect
        - the need these warriors had for strong leadership and
        - decisive action.
        - Thus, they see their deities in every
        - bend of a river, hear them in the crash of the thunder
        - and the boom ing of the glaciers, and smell them in the
        - sm oke of a burning longhouse.
        - The Norse pantheon includes two main families, the
        - Aesir (deities of war and destiny) and the Vanir (gods
        - of fertility and prosperity).
        - Once enemies, these two
        - families are now closely allied against their com m on
        - enemies, the giants (including the gods Surtur and
        - Thrym).
        - Like the gods of Greyhawk, gods in different
        - families som etim es have overlap in their spheres of
        - 'influence: Frey (of the Vanir) and Odur (of the Aesir)'
        - are both associated with the sun, for example.

        - where magic com bines with advanced technology and
        - others trapped in an endless Stone Age, worlds where
        - the gods walk and places they have abandoned.

        - Each of these worlds boasts its own cast of
        - heroic adventurers and schem ing villains, its own
        - ancient ruins and forgotten artifacts, its own dungeons
        - and its own dragons.
        - But if your campaign takes place
        - "on one of these worlds, it belongs to your DM\u2014you"
        - might imagine it as one of thousands of parallel versions

        - INSPIRATION FOR ALL OF THE FANTASY WORK I HAVE
        - done stems directly from the love my father
        - showed when I was a lad, for he spent many
        - hours telling me stories he made up as he went
        - along, tales o f cloaked old men who could grant
        - wishes, of magic rings and enchanted swords,
        - or wicked sorcerers and dauntless swordsmen. .

        - All of us tend to get ample helpings of fantasy
        - when we are very young, from fairy tales such as those
        - written by the Brothers Grimm and Andrew Lang.
        - This often leads to reading books of mythology, paging
        - through bestiaries, and consultation of compilations
        - of the myths of various lands and peoples.
        - Upon such
        - a base I built my interest in fantasy, being an avid
        - reader of all science fiction and fantasy literature
        - since 1950.
