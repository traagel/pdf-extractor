  Preface\nONCE UPON A TIME, LONG, LONG AGO, IN A\nrealm called the Midwestern United\n\
  States\u2014specifically the states o f Minne\xAD\nsota and W isconsin\u2014a group\
  \ of friends\ngathered together to forever alter the\nhistory o f gaming.\nIt wasn\u2019\
  t their intent to do so.\nThey were\ntired of merely reading tales about worlds\
  \ of magic,\nmonsters, and adventure.\nThey wanted to play in those\nworlds, rather\
  \ than observe them.\nThat they went on\nto invent D u n g e o n s & D r a g o n\
  \ s , and thereby ignite a\nrevolution in gaming that continues to this day, speaks\n\
  to two things.\nFirst, it speaks to their ingenuity and genius in fig\xAD\nuring\
  \ out that gam es w ere the perfect way to explore\nw orlds that could not otherwise\
  \ exist.\nAlm ost every\nm odern game, whether played on a digital device or\na\
  \ tabletop, ow es som e debt to D&D.\nSecond, it is a testament to the inherent\
  \ appeal of the\ngame they created.\nD u n g e o n s & D r a g o n s sparked a\n\
  thriving global phenomenon.\nIt is the first roleplaying\ngame, and it remains one\
  \ of the best of its breed.\nTo play D&D, and to play it well, you don\u2019t need\
  \ to\nread all the rules, m em orize every detail of the game,\nor master the fine\
  \ art o f rolling funny looking dice.\nNone of those things have any bearing on\
  \ what\u2019s best\nabout the game.\nW hat you need are two things, the first being\
  \ friends\nwith whom you can share the game.\nPlaying games with\nyour friends is\
  \ a lot of fun, but D&D does som ething\nm ore than entertain.\nPlaying D&D is an\
  \ exercise in collaborative creation.\nYou and your friends create epic stories\
  \ filled with ten\xAD\nsion and memorable drama.\nYou create silly in-jokes\nthat\
  \ make you laugh years later.\nThe dice will be cruel\nto you, but you will soldier\
  \ on.\nYour collective creativ\xAD\nity will build stories that you will tell again\
  \ and again,\nranging from the utterly absurd to the stuff of legend.\nIf you don\u2019\
  t have friends interested in playing, don\u2019t\nworry.\nThere\u2019s a special\
  \ alchemy that takes place\naround a D&D table that nothing else can match.\nPlay\n\
  the game with som eone enough, and the two of you\nare likely to end up friends.\n\
  It\u2019s a cool side effect o f the\ngame.\nYour next gaming group is as close\
  \ as the nearest\ngame store, online forum, or gaming convention.\nThe second thing\
  \ you need is a lively imagination\nor, m ore importantly, the willingness to use\
  \ whatever\nimagination you have.\nYou don\u2019t need to be a master\nstoryteller\
  \ or a brilliant artist.\nYou just need to aspire to\ncreate, to have the courage\
  \ of som eone who is willing to\nbuild som ething and share it with others.\nLuckily,\
  \ just as D&D can strengthen your friendships,\nit can help build in you the confidence\
  \ to create and\nshare.\nD&D is a game that teaches you to look for the\nclever\
  \ solution, share the sudden idea that can overcom e\na problem, and push yourself\
  \ to imagine what could be,\nrather than simply accept what is.\nThe first characters\
  \ and adventures you create will\nprobably be a collection of cliches.\nThat\u2019\
  s true of every\xAD\none, from the greatest Dungeon Masters in history on\ndown.\n\
  Accept this reality and move on to create the\nsecond character or adventure, which\
  \ will be better,\nand then the third, w hich will be better still.\nRepeat that\n\
  over the course of time, and soon you\u2019ll be able to create\nanything, from\
  \ a character\u2019s background story to an epic\nworld of fantasy adventure.\n\
  Once you have that skill, it\u2019s yours forever.\nCountless\nwriters, artists,\
  \ and other creators can trace their begin\xAD\nnings to a few pages o f D&D notes,\
  \ a handful of dice,\nand a kitchen table.\nAbove all else, D&D is yours.\nThe friendships\
  \ you\nmake around the table will be unique to you.\nThe adven\xAD\ntures you embark\
  \ on, the characters you create, the\nm em ories you make\u2014these will be yours.\n\
  D&D is your\npersonal corner of the universe, a place where you have\nfree reign\
  \ to do as you wish.\nG o forth now.\nRead the rules of the game and the\nstory\
  \ of its worlds, but always remember that you are\nthe one who brings them to life.\n\
  They are nothing\nwithout the spark of life that you give them.\nMike Mearls\nMay\
  \ 2014\nIn t r o d u c t io n\nThe D u n g e o n s & D r a g o n s r o le p la y\
  \ in g\ngame is about storytelling in w orlds of\nsw ords and sorcery.\nIt shares\
  \ elements\nwith childhood games of make-believe.\nLike\nthose games, D & D is driven\
  \ by imagina\xAD\ntion.\nIt\u2019s about picturing the towering castle\nbeneath\
  \ the stormy night sky and imagining\nhow a fantasy adventurer might react to the\
  \ challenges\nthat scene presents.\nDungeon Master (DM): After passing through the\n\
  craggy peaks, the road takes a sudden turn to the east\nand Castle Ravenloft towers\
  \ before you.\nCrumbling\ntowers of stone keep a silent watch over the approach.\n\
  They look like abandoned guardhouses.\nBeyond these,\na wide chasm gapes, disappearing\
  \ into the deep\nfog below.\nA lowered drawbridge spans the chasm,\nleading to an\
  \ arched entrance to the castle courtyard.\nThe chains of the drawbridge creak in\
  \ the wind, their\nrust-eaten iron straining with the weight.\nFrom atop\nthe high\
  \ strong walls, stone gargoyles stare at you\nfrom hollow sockets and grin hideously.\n\
  A rotting\nwooden portcullis, green with growth, hangs in the\nentry tunnel.\nBeyond\
  \ this, the main doors of Castle\nRavenloft stand open, a rich warm light spilling\
  \ into\nthe courtyard.\nPhillip (playing Gareth): I want to look at the\ngargoyles.\n\
  I have a feeling they\u2019re not just statues.\nAmy (playing Riva): The drawbridge\
  \ looks precarious?\nI want to see how sturdy it is.\nDo I think we can cross\n\
  it, or is it going to collapse under our weight?\nUnlike a game of make-believe,\
  \ D&D gives structure\nto the stories, a way of determining the consequences\nof\
  \ the adventurers\u2019 action.\nPlayers roll dice to resolve\nwhether their attacks\
  \ hit or m iss or whether their adven\xAD\nturers can scale a cliff, roll away from\
  \ the strike of a\nm agical lightning bolt, or pull off som e other dangerous\n\
  task.\nAnything is possible, but the dice make som e out\xAD\ncom es m ore probable\
  \ than others.\nDungeon Master (DM): OK, one at a time.\nPhillip,\nyou\u2019re looking\
  \ at the gargoyles?\nPhillip: Yeah.\nIs there any hint they might be\ncreatures\
  \ and not decorations?\nDM: Make an Intelligence check.\nPhillip: Does my Investigation\
  \ skill apply?\nDM: Sure!\nPhillip (rolling a d20): Ugh.\nSeven.\nDM: They look\
  \ like decorations to you.\nAnd Amy,\nRiva is checking out the drawbridge?\nIn the\
  \ D u n g e o n s & D r a g o n s game, each player\ncreates an adventurer (also\
  \ called a character) and\nteams up with other adventurers (played by friends).\n\
  W orking together, the group might explore a dark dun\xAD\ngeon, a ruined city,\
  \ a haunted castle, a lost temple deep\nin a jungle, or a lava-filled cavern beneath\
  \ a mysterious\nmountain.\nThe adventurers can solve puzzles, talk with\nother characters,\
  \ battle fantastic monsters, and discover\nfabulous magic items and other treasure.\n\
  One player, however, takes on the role of the Dungeon\nMaster (DM), the gam e\u2019\
  s lead storyteller and referee.\nThe DM creates adventures for the characters, who\
  \ nav\xAD\nigate its hazards and decide which paths to explore.\nThe\nDM might describe\
  \ the entrance to Castle Ravenloft,\nand the players decide what they want their\
  \ adventurers\nto do.\nWill they walk across the dangerously weathered\ndrawbridge?\n\
  Tie themselves together with rope to mini\xAD\nm ize the chance that som eone will\
  \ fall if the drawbridge\ngives way?\nOr cast a spell to carry them over the chasm?\n\
  Then the DM determines the results of the adventur\xAD\ners\u2019 actions and narrates\
  \ what they experience.\nBecause\nthe DM can improvise to react to anything the\
  \ players\nattempt, D&D is infinitely flexible, and each adventure\ncan be exciting\
  \ and unexpected.\nThe game has no real end; when one story or quest\nwraps up,\
  \ another one can begin, creating an ongoing\nstory called a campaign.\nMany people\
  \ who play the\ngame keep their cam paigns going for months or years,\nmeeting with\
  \ their friends every week or so to pick\nup the story where they left off.\nThe\
  \ adventurers grow\nin might as the campaign continues.\nEach monster\ndefeated,\
  \ each adventure completed, and each treasure\nrecovered not only adds to the continuing\
  \ story, but also\nearns the adventurers new capabilities.\nThis increase\nin power\
  \ is reflected by an adventurer\u2019s level.\nThere\u2019s no winning and losing\
  \ in the D u n g e o n s &\nD r a g o n s game\u2014at least, not the way those\
  \ terms are\nusually understood.\nTogether, the D M and the players\ncreate an exciting\
  \ story of bold adventurers who confront\ndeadly perils.\nSom etim es an adventurer\
  \ might com e to\na grisly end, torn apart by ferocious monsters or done in\nby\
  \ a nefarious villain.\nEven so, the other adventurers can\nsearch for powerful\
  \ magic to revive their fallen comrade,\nor the player might choose to create a\
  \ new character to\ncarry on.\nThe group might fail to complete an adventure\nsuccessfully,\
  \ but if everyone had a good time and created\na memorable story, they all win.\n\
  W o r ld s of A d v e n t u r e\nThe many worlds of the D u n g e o n s & D r a\
  \ g o n s game\nare places o f magic and monsters, of brave warriors and\nspectacular\
  \ adventures.\nThey begin with a foundation\nof medieval fantasy and then add the\
  \ creatures, places,\nand magic that make these worlds unique.\nThe worlds of the\
  \ D u n g e o n s & D r a g o n s game exist\nwithin a vast cosm os called the multiverse,\
  \ connected\nin strange and mysterious ways to one another and to\nother planes\
  \ of existence, such as the Elemental Plane\nof Fire and the Infinite Depths of\
  \ the Abyss.\nWithin\nthis multiverse are an endless variety of worlds.\nMany\n\
  of them have been published as official settings for the\nD&D game.\nThe legends\
  \ of the Forgotten Realms, Drag-\nonlance, Greyhawk, Dark Sun, Mystara, and Eberron\n\
  settings are woven together in the fabric of the multi-\nverse.\nAlongside these\
  \ worlds are hundreds of thousands\nmore, created by generations of D&D players\
  \ for their\nown games.\nAnd amid all the richness of the multiverse,\nyou might\
  \ create a world of your own.\nAll these worlds share characteristics, but each\
  \ world\nis set apart by its own history and cultures, distinctive\nmonsters and\
  \ races, fantastic geography, ancient dun\xAD\ngeons, and schem ing villains.\n\
  Som e races have unusual\ntraits in different worlds.\nThe halflings of the Dark\
  \ Sun\nsetting, for example, are jungle-dwelling cannibals,\nand the elves are desert\
  \ nomads.\nSom e worlds feature\nraces unknown in other settings, such as Eberron\u2019\
  s war-\nforged, soldiers created and im bued with life to fight in\nthe Last War.\n\
  Som e worlds are dominated by one great\nstory, like the War of the Lance that plays\
  \ a central role\nin the Dragonlance setting.\nBut they\u2019re all D&D worlds,\n\
  and you can use the rules in this book to create a char\xAD\nacter and play in any\
  \ one of them.\nYour DM might set the campaign on one of these\nworlds or on one\
  \ that he or she created.\nBecause there\nis so much diversity am ong the worlds\
  \ of D&D, you\nshould check with your DM about any house rules that\nwill affect\
  \ your play of the game.\nUltimately, the Dun\xAD\ngeon Master is the authority\
  \ on the campaign and its\nsetting, even if the setting is a published world.\n\
  U s in g T h is B o o k\nThe Player\u2019s Handbook is divided into three parts.\n\
  Part 1 is about creating a character, providing the\nrules and guidance you need\
  \ to make the character\nyou\u2019ll play in the game.\nIt includes information\
  \ on the\nvarious races, classes, backgrounds, equipment, and\nother customization\
  \ options that you can choose from.\nMany of the rules in part 1 rely on material\
  \ in parts 2\nand 3.\nIf you com e across a game concept in part 1 that\nyou don\u2019\
  t understand, consult the book\u2019s index.\nPart 2 details the rules of how to\
  \ play the game,\nbeyond the basics described in this introduction.\nThat\npart\
  \ covers the kinds of die rolls you make to determine\nsuccess or failure at the\
  \ tasks your character attempts,\nand describes the three broad categories o f activity\
  \ in\nthe game: exploration, interaction, and combat.\nPart 3 is all about magic.\n\
  It covers the nature of magic\nin the worlds of D&D, the rules for spellcasting,\
  \ and the\nhuge variety o f spells available to magic-using charac\xAD\nters (and\
  \ monsters) in the game.\nHow t o Pl a y\nThe play of the D u n g e o n s & D r\
  \ a g o n s game unfolds\naccording to this basic pattern.\n1.\nThe DM describes\
  \ the environment.\nThe DM\ntells the players where their adventurers are and what\u2019\
  s\naround them, presenting the basic scope of options that\npresent themselves (how\
  \ many doors lead out of a room,\nwhat\u2019s on a table, w ho\u2019s in the tavern,\
  \ and so on).\n2.\nThe players describe what they want to do.\nS om e\xAD\ntimes\
  \ one player speaks for the whole party, saying,\n\u201CW e\u2019ll take the east\
  \ door,\u201D for example.\nOther times,\ndifferent adventurers do different things:\
  \ one adventurer\nmight search a treasure chest while a second exam ines\nan esoteric\
  \ sym bol engraved on a wall and a third keeps\nwatch for monsters.\nThe players\
  \ don\u2019t need to take\nturns, but the DM listens to every player and decides\n\
  how to resolve those actions.\nSom etim es, resolving a task is easy.\nIf an adventurer\n\
  wants to walk across a room and open a door, the DM\nmight just say that the door\
  \ opens and describe what\nlies beyond.\nBut the door might be locked, the floor\n\
  might hide a deadly trap, or som e other circum stance\nmight make it challenging\
  \ for an adventurer to complete\na task.\nIn those cases, the DM decides what happens,\n\
  often relying on the roll of a die to determine the results\nof an action.\n3.\n\
  The DM narrates the results of the adventurers\u2019\nactions.\nDescribing the results\
  \ often leads to another\ndecision point, which brings the flow of the game right\n\
  back to step 1.\nThis pattern holds whether the adventurers are cau\xAD\ntiously\
  \ exploring a ruin, talking to a devious prince, or\nlocked in mortal combat against\
  \ a mighty dragon.\nIn\ncertain situations, particularly combat, the action is\n\
  m ore structured and the players (and DM) do take turns\nchoosing and resolving\
  \ actions.\nBut m ost of the time,\nplay is fluid and flexible, adapting to the\
  \ circum stances\nof the adventure.\nOften the action of an adventure takes place\
  \ in the\nimagination of the players and DM, relying on the DM \u2019s\nverbal descriptions\
  \ to set the scene.\nSom e DMs like to\nuse music, art, or recorded sound effects\
  \ to help set the\nm ood, and many players and DMs alike adopt different\nvoices\
  \ for the various adventurers, monsters, and other\ncharacters they play in the\
  \ game.\nSom etim es, a DM\nmight lay out a map and use tokens or miniature figures\n\
  to represent each creature involved in a scene to help\nthe players keep track of\
  \ where everyone is.\nG a m e D i c e\nThe game uses polyhedral dice with different\
  \ numbers\nof sides.\nYou can find dice like these in game stores and\nin many bookstores.\n\
  In these rules, the different dice are referred to by the\nletter d followed by\
  \ the number of sides: d4, d6, d8, d 10,\nd 12, and d20.\nFor instance, a d6 is\
  \ a six-sided die (the\ntypical cube that many gam es use).\nPercentile dice, or\
  \ d 100, work a little differently.\nYou\ngenerate a number between 1 and 100 by\
  \ rolling two\ndifferent ten-sided dice num bered from 0 to 9.\nOne die\n(designated\
  \ before you roll) gives the tens digit, and\nthe other gives the ones digit.\n\
  If you roll a 7 and a 1, for\nexample, the number rolled is 71.\nTwo Os represent\
  \ 100.\nSom e ten-sided dice are numbered in tens (00, 10, 20,\nand so on), making\
  \ it easier to distinguish the tens digit\nfrom the ones digit.\nIn this case, a\
  \ roll of 70 and 1 is 71,\nand 00 and 0 is 100.\nW hen you need to roll dice, the\
  \ rules tell you how\nmany dice to roll o f a certain type, as well as what m od\xAD\
  \nifiers to add.\nFor example, \u201C3d8 + 5 \u201D means you roll\nthree eight-sided\
  \ dice, add them together, and add 5\nto the total.\nThe sam e d notation appears\
  \ in the expressions \u201C1d3\u201D\nand \u201C1d2.\u201D To simulate the roll\
  \ of 1d3, roll a d6 and\ndivide the num ber rolled by 2 (round up).\nTo simulate\n\
  the roll of 1d2, roll any die and assign a 1 or 2 to the roll\ndepending on whether\
  \ it w as odd or even. (Alternatively,\nif the number rolled is m ore than half\
  \ the number of\nsides on the die, it\u2019s a 2.)\nT h e D 2 0\nD oes an adventurer\u2019\
  s sword swing hurt a dragon or just\nbounce off its iron-hard scales?\nWill the\
  \ ogre believe an\noutrageous bluff?\nCan a character swim across a raging\nriver?\n\
  Can a character avoid the main blast of a fireball,\nor does he or she take full\
  \ damage from the blaze?\nIn\ncases w here the outcom e of an action is uncertain,\n\
  the D u n g e o n s & D r a g o n s game relies on rolls o f a\n20-sided die, a\
  \ d20, to determine success or failure.\nEvery character and monster in the game\
  \ has capa\xAD\nbilities defined by six ability scores.\nThe abilities are\nStrength,\
  \ Dexterity, Constitution, Intelligence, W isdom,\nand Charisma, and they typically\
  \ range from 3 to 18\nfor m ost adventurers. (Monsters might have scores as\nlow\
  \ as 1 or as high as 30.) These ability scores, and the\nability modifiers derived\
  \ from them, are the basis for\nalmost every d20 roll that a player m akes on a\
  \ charac\xAD\nter\u2019s or monster\u2019s behalf.\nAbility checks, attack rolls,\
  \ and saving throws are the\nthree main kinds of d20 rolls, forming the core of\
  \ the\nrules of the game.\nAll three follow these simple steps.\n1.\nRoll the die\
  \ and add a modifier.\nRoll a d20 and\nadd the relevant modifier.\nThis is typically\
  \ the m od\xAD\nifier derived from one of the six ability scores, and it\nsom etim\
  \ es includes a proficiency bonus to reflect a char\xAD\nacter\u2019s particular\
  \ skill. (See chapter 1 for details on each\nability and how to determine an ability\u2019\
  s modifier.)\n2.\nApply circumstantial bonuses and penalties.\nA\nclass feature,\
  \ a spell, a particular circum stance, or som e\nother effect might give a bonus\
  \ or penalty to the check.\n3.\nCompare the total to a target number.\nIf the total\n\
  equals or exceeds the target number, the ability check,\nattack roll, or saving\
  \ throw is a success.\nOtherwise, it\u2019s\na failure.\nThe DM is usually the one\
  \ w ho determines\ntarget numbers and tells players whether their ability\nchecks,\
  \ attack rolls, and saving throws succeed or fail.\nThe target number for an ability\
  \ check or a saving\nthrow is called a Difficulty Class (DC).\nThe target\nnumber\
  \ for an attack roll is called an Armor Class (AC).\nThis simple rule governs the\
  \ resolution of m ost tasks\nin D&D play.\nChapter 7 provides m ore detailed rules\
  \ for\nusing the d20 in the game.\nA d v a n t a g e a n d D i s a d v a n t a g\
  \ e\nSom etim es an ability check, attack roll, or saving throw\nis modified by\
  \ special situations called advantage and\ndisadvantage.\nAdvantage reflects the\
  \ positive circum \xAD\nstances surrounding a d20 roll, while disadvantage\nreflects\
  \ the opposite.\nW hen you have either advantage or\ndisadvantage, you roll a second\
  \ d20 w hen you make the\nroll.\nUse the higher of the two rolls if you have advan\xAD\
  \ntage, and use the lower roll if you have disadvantage.\nFor example, if you have\
  \ disadvantage and roll a 17 and\na 5, you use the 5.\nIf you instead have advantage\
  \ and roll\nthose numbers, you use the 17.\nMore detailed rules for advantage and\
  \ disadvantage\nare presented in chapter 7.\nS p e c i f i c B e a t s G e n e r\
  \ a l\nThis book contains rules, especially in parts 2 and 3,\nthat govern how the\
  \ game plays.\nThat said, many racial\ntraits, class features, spells, magic items,\
  \ monster abili\xAD\nties, and other game elements break the general rules in\n\
  som e way, creating an exception to how the rest o f the\ngame works.\nRem em ber\
  \ this: If a specific rule contra\xAD\ndicts a general rule, the specific rule wins.\n\
  Exceptions to the rules are often minor.\nFor instance,\nmany adventurers don\u2019\
  t have proficiency with longbows,\nbut every w ood elf does because of a racial\
  \ trait.\nThat\ntrait creates a m inor exception in the game.\nOther\nexamples of\
  \ rule-breaking are m ore conspicuous.\nFor\ninstance, an adventurer can\u2019t\
  \ normally pass through\nwalls, but som e spells make that possible.\nMagic\naccounts\
  \ for m ost o f the major exceptions to the rules.\nR o u n d D o w n\nThere\u2019\
  s one m ore general rule you need to know at the\noutset.\nW henever you divide\
  \ a number in the game,\nround down if you end up with a fraction, even if the\n\
  fraction is one-half or greater.\nA d v e n t u r e s\nThe D u n g e o n s & D r\
  \ a g o n s game consists of a group\nof characters embarking on an adventure that\
  \ the Dun\xAD\ngeon Master presents to them.\nEach character brings\nparticular\
  \ capabilities to the adventure in the form of\nability scores and skills, class\
  \ features, racial traits,\nequipment, and magic items.\nEvery character is dif\xAD\
  \nferent, with various strengths and w eaknesses, so the\nbest party of adventurers\
  \ is one in which the characters\ncomplem ent each other and cover the w eaknesses\
  \ of\ntheir com panions.\nThe adventurers must cooperate to\nsuccessfully complete\
  \ the adventure.\nThe adventure is the heart of the game, a story with\na beginning,\
  \ a middle, and an end.\nAn adventure might\nbe created by the Dungeon Master or\
  \ purchased off the\nshelf, tweaked and modified to suit the DM \u2019s needs and\n\
  desires.\nIn either case, an adventure features a fantastic\nsetting, whether it\u2019\
  s an underground dungeon, a crum \xAD\nbling castle, a stretch of wilderness, or\
  \ a bustling city.\nIt features a rich cast o f characters: the adventurers\ncreated\
  \ and played by the other players at the table,\nas well as nonplayer characters\
  \ (NPCs).\nThose char\xAD\nacters might be patrons, allies, enemies, hirelings,\
  \ or\njust background extras in an adventure.\nOften, one of\nthe NPCs is a villain\
  \ w hose agenda drives much of an\nadventure\u2019s action.\nOver the course of\
  \ their adventures, the characters\nare confronted by a variety of creatures, objects,\
  \ and\nsituations that they must deal with in som e way.\nS om e\xAD\ntimes the\
  \ adventurers and other creatures do their\nbest to kill or capture each other in\
  \ combat.\nAt other\ntimes, the adventurers talk to another creature (or even\n\
  a magical object) with a goal in mind.\nAnd often, the\nadventurers spend time trying\
  \ to solve a puzzle, bypass\nan obstacle, find som ething hidden, or unravel the\
  \ cur\xAD\nrent situation.\nMeanwhile, the adventurers explore the\nworld, making\
  \ decisions about which way to travel and\nwhat they\u2019ll try to do next.\nAdventures\
  \ vary in length and complexity.\nA short\nadventure might present only a few challenges,\
  \ and\nit might take no m ore than a single game session to\ncomplete.\nA long adventure\
  \ can involve hundreds of\ncombats, interactions, and other challenges, and take\n\
  dozens o f sessions to play through, stretching over\nweeks or months of real time.\n\
  Usually, the end of an\nadventure is marked by the adventurers heading back to\n\
  civilization to rest and enjoy the spoils of their labors.\nBut that\u2019s not\
  \ the end of the story.\nYou can think of\nan adventure as a single episode of a\
  \ TV series, made\nup of multiple exciting scenes.\nA campaign is the whole\nseries\u2014\
  a string o f adventures joined together, with a\nconsistent group of adventurers\
  \ following the narrative\nfrom start to finish.\nT h e T h r e e P i l l a r s\
  \ o f A d v e n t u r e\nAdventurers can try to do anything their players can\n\
  imagine, but it can be helpful to talk about their activ\xAD\nities in three broad\
  \ categories: exploration, social\ninteraction, and combat.\nExploration includes\
  \ both the adventurers\u2019 movement\nthrough the world and their interaction with\
  \ objects and\nsituations that require their attention.\nExploration is the\ngive-and-take\
  \ of the players describing what they want\ntheir characters to do, and the Dungeon\
  \ Master telling\nthe players what happens as a result.\nOn a large scale,\nthat\
  \ might involve the characters spending a day cross\xAD\ning a rolling plain or\
  \ an hour making their way through\ncaverns underground.\nOn the sm allest scale,\
  \ it could\nmean one character pulling a lever in a dungeon room to\nsee what happens.\n\
  Social interaction features the adventurers talking to\nsom eone (or som ething)\
  \ else.\nIt might mean demanding\nthat a captured scout reveal the secret entrance\
  \ to the\ngoblin lair, getting information from a rescued prisoner,\npleading for\
  \ mercy from an orc chieftain, or persuading\na talkative magic m irror to show\
  \ a distant location to\nthe adventurers.\nThe rules in chapters 7 and 8 support\
  \ exploration and\nsocial interaction, as do many class features in chapter 3\n\
  and personality traits in chapter 4.\nCombat, the focus of chapter 9, involves characters\n\
  and other creatures swinging weapons, casting spells,\nmaneuvering for position,\
  \ and so on\u2014all in an effort\nto defeat their opponents, whether that means\
  \ killing\nevery enemy, taking captives, or forcing a rout.\nCombat\nis the most\
  \ structured element o f a D&D session, with\ncreatures taking turns to make sure\
  \ that everyone gets\na chance to act.\nEven in the context of a pitched battle,\n\
  there\u2019s still plenty of opportunity for adventurers to\nattempt wacky stunts\
  \ like surfing down a flight of stairs\non a shield, to examine the environment\
  \ (perhaps by\npulling a mysterious lever), and to interact with other\ncreatures,\
  \ including allies, enem ies, and neutral parties.\nT h e W o n d e r s o f M a\
  \ g i c\nFew D&D adventures end without som ething magical\nhappening.\nW hether\
  \ helpful or harmful, magic appears\nfrequently in the life of an adventurer, and\
  \ it is the focus\nof chapters 10 and 11.\nIn the worlds of D u n g e o n s & D\
  \ r a g o n s , practitioners\nof magic are rare, set apart from the m asses o f\
  \ people\nby their extraordinary talent.\nCom m on folk might see\nevidence of magic\
  \ on a regular basis, but it\u2019s usually\nm inor\u2014a fantastic monster, a\
  \ visibly answered prayer,\na wizard walking through the streets with an animated\n\
  shield guardian as a bodyguard.\nFor adventurers, though, magic is key to their\
  \ sur\xAD\nvival.\nWithout the healing magic of clerics and paladins,\nadventurers\
  \ would quickly succum b to their wounds.\nWithout the uplifting magical support\
  \ of bards and\nclerics, warriors might be overwhelmed by powerful\nfoes.\nWithout\
  \ the sheer magical power and versatility\nof wizards and druids, every threat w\
  \ ould be mag\xAD\nnified tenfold.\nMagic is also a favored tool of villains.\n\
  Many adven\xAD\ntures are driven by the machinations of spellcasters\nw ho are hellbent\
  \ on using magic for som e ill end.\nA cult\nleader seeks to awaken a god w ho slum\
  \ bers beneath\nthe sea, a hag kidnaps youths to magically drain them\no f their\
  \ vigor, a mad wizard labors to invest an army of\nautomatons with a facsimile of\
  \ life, a dragon begins a\nmystical ritual to rise up as a god of destruction\u2014\
  these\nare just a few of the magical threats that adventurers\nmight face.\nWith\
  \ magic o f their own, in the form of\nspells and magic items, the adventurers might\
  \ prevail!\nC h a p t e r 1: St e p - b y-S te p C h a r a c t e r s\nOUR FIRST\
  \ STEP IN PLAYING AN ADVENTURER IN THE\nD u n g e o n s & D r a g o n s game is\
  \ to imagine\nand create a character of your own.\nYour\ncharacter is a combination\
  \ of game statistics,\nroleplaying hooks, and your imagination.\nYou\nchoose a race\
  \ (such as human or halfling) and\na class (such as fighter or wizard).\nYou also\n\
  invent the personality, appearance, and backstory of\nyour character.\nOnce completed,\
  \ your character serves\nas your representative in the game, your avatar in the\n\
  D u n g e o n s & D r a g o n s world.\nBefore you dive into step 1 below, think\
  \ about the\nkind o f adventurer you want to play.\nYou might be a\ncourageous fighter,\
  \ a skulking rogue, a fervent cleric, or\na flamboyant wizard.\nOr you might be\
  \ m ore interested\nin an unconventional character, such as a brawny rogue\nwho\
  \ likes hand-to-hand combat, or a sharpshooter who\npicks off enem ies from afar.\n\
  D o you like fantasy fiction\nfeaturing dwarves or elves?\nTry building a character\
  \ of\none of those races.\nD o you want your character to be the\ntoughest adventurer\
  \ at the table?\nConsider a class like\nbarbarian or paladin.\nIf you don\u2019\
  t know where else to\nbegin, take a look at the illustrations in this book to see\n\
  what catches your interest.\nOnce you have a character in mind, follow these steps\n\
  in order, making decisions that reflect the character you\nwant.\nYour conception\
  \ of your character might evolve\nwith each choice you make.\nW hat\u2019s important\
  \ is that you\ncom e to the table with a character you\u2019re excited to play.\n\
  Throughout this chapter, w e use the term character\nsheet to mean whatever you\
  \ use to track your character,\nwhether it\u2019s a form al character sheet (like\
  \ the one at the\nend of this book), som e form of digital record, or a piece\n\
  of notebook paper.\nAn official D&D character sheet is a\nfine place to start until\
  \ you know what information you\nneed and how you use it during the game.\nB u i\
  \ l d i n g B r u e n o r\nEach step o f character creation includes an example\
  \ of\nthat step, with a player named Bob building his dwarf\ncharacter, Bruenor.\n\
  1.\nC h o o s e a R a c e\nEvery character belongs to a race, one of the many\n\
  intelligent humanoid species in the D&D world.\nThe\nmost com m on player character\
  \ races are dwarves, elves,\nhalflings, and humans.\nSom e races also have subraces,\n\
  such as mountain dwarf or w ood elf.\nChapter 2 provides\nm ore information about\
  \ these races, as well as the less\nwidespread races of dragonborn, gnom es, half-elves,\n\
  half-orcs, and tieflings.\nThe race you choose contributes to your character\u2019\
  s\nidentity in an important way, by establishing a general\nappearance and the natural\
  \ talents gained from culture\nand ancestry.\nYour character\u2019s race grants\
  \ particular\nracial traits, such as special senses, proficiency with\ncertain w\
  \ eapons or tools, proficiency in one or more\nskills, or the ability to use minor\
  \ spells.\nThese traits\nsom etim es dovetail with the capabilities of certain\n\
  classes (see step 2).\nFor example, the racial traits of\nlightfoot halflings make\
  \ them exceptional rogues, and\nhigh elves tend to be powerful wizards.\nSom etim\
  \ es\nplaying against type can be fun, too.\nHalf-orc paladins\nand mountain dwarf\
  \ wizards, for example, can be\nunusual but memorable characters.\nYour race also\
  \ increases one or m ore of your ability\nscores, which you determine in step 3.\n\
  Note these\nincreases and remember to apply them later.\nRecord the traits granted\
  \ by your race on your\ncharacter sheet.\nBe sure to note your starting\nlanguages\
  \ and your base speed as well.\nB u i l d i n g B r u e n o r , St e p 1\nBob is\
  \ sitting down to create his character.\nHe decides\nthat a gruff mountain dwarf\
  \ fits the character he wants\nto play.\nHe notes all the racial traits of dwarves\
  \ on his\ncharacter sheet, including his speed of 25 feet and the\nlanguages he\
  \ knows: Com m on and Dwarvish.\n2.\nC h o o s e a C l a s s\nEvery adventurer is\
  \ a m em ber of a class.\nClass broadly\ndescribes a character\u2019s vocation,\
  \ what special talents he\nor she possesses, and the tactics he or she is most likely\n\
  to employ when exploring a dungeon, fighting monsters,\nor engaging in a tense negotiation.\n\
  The character\nclasses are described in chapter 3.\nYour character receives a number\
  \ of benefits from\nyour choice of class.\nMany of these benefits are class\nfeatures\u2014\
  capabilities (including spellcasting) that set\nyour character apart from m em bers\
  \ of other classes.\nYou also gain a number of proficiencies: armor,\nweapons, skills,\
  \ saving throws, and som etim es tools.\nYour proficiencies define many o f the\
  \ things your\ncharacter can do particularly well, from using certain\nw eapons\
  \ to telling a convincing lie.\nOn your character sheet, record all the features\
  \ that\nyour class gives you at 1st level.\nL e v e l\nTypically, a character starts\
  \ at 1st level and advances\nin level by adventuring and gaining experience points\n\
  (XP).\nA 1st-level character is inexperienced in the\nadventuring world, although\
  \ he or she might have been\na soldier or a pirate and done dangerous things before.\n\
  Starting off at 1st level marks your character\u2019s entry\ninto the adventuring\
  \ life.\nIf you\u2019re already familiar\nwith the game, or if you are joining an\
  \ existing D&D\ncampaign, your DM might decide to have you begin at a\nhigher level,\
  \ on the assumption that your character has\nalready survived a few harrowing adventures.\n\
  Q u i c k B u i l d\nEach class description in chapter 3 includes a section\noffering\
  \ suggestions to quickly build a character of that\nclass, including how to assign\
  \ your highest ability scores,\na background suitable to the class, and starting\
  \ spells.\nPART 1 S TE P-B Y -STE P CHARACTERS\nRecord your level on your character\

  \ Level\u201D later in this chapter).\nH i t P o i n t s a n d H i t D ic e\nYour\
  \ character\u2019s hit points define how tough your\ncharacter is in combat and\

  \ your character has 1 Hit Die, and the\ndie type is determined by your class.\n\
  You start with hit\npoints equal to the highest roll of that die, as indicated in\n\
  your class description. (You also add your Constitution\nmodifier, which you\u2019\
  ll determine in step 3.) This is also\nyour hit point maximum.\nR ecord your character\u2019\
  s hit points on your character\nsheet.\nAlso record the type o f Hit Die your character\n\
  uses and the number of Hit D ice you have.\nAfter you\nrest, you can spend Hit D\
  \ ice to regain hit points (see\n\u201CResting\u201D in chapter 8).\nP r o f i c\
  \ i e n c y B o n u s\nThe table that appears in your class description shows\n\
  your proficiency bonus, which is +2 for a 1st-level\ncharacter.\nYour proficiency\

  \ eapon proficiencies,\nyour saving throw proficiencies, and som e of your skill\n\
  and tool proficiencies. (Skills are described in chapter 7,\ntools in chapter 5.)\
  \ Your background gives you additional\nskill and tool proficiencies, and som e\
  \ races give\nyou m ore proficiencies.\nBe sure to note all o f these\nproficiencies,\
  \ as well as your proficiency bonus, on your\ncharacter sheet.\nYour proficiency\
  \ bonus can\u2019t be added to a single die\nroll or other num ber m ore than once.\n\
  Occasionally, your\nproficiency bonus might be modified (doubled or halved,\nfor\
  \ example) before you apply it.\nIf a circum stance\nsuggests that your proficiency\
  \ bonus applies m ore than\nonce to the sam e roll or that it should be multiplied\n\
  m ore than once, you nevertheless add it only once,\nmultiply it only once, and\
  \ halve it only once.\nB u i l d i n g B r u e n o r , St e p 2\nBob im agines Bruenor\
  \ charging into battle with an axe,\none horn on his helmet broken off.\nHe makes\
  \ Bruenor a\nfighter and notes the fighter\u2019s proficiencies and 1st-level\n\
  class features on his character sheet.\nAs a 1st-level fighter, Bruenor has 1 Hit\
  \ Die\u2014a d 10\u2014\nand starts with hit points equal to 10 + his Constitution\n\
  modifier.\nBob notes this, and will record the final\nnumber after he determines\
  \ Bruenor\u2019s Constitution\nscore (see step 3).\nBob also notes the proficiency\
  \ bonus\nfor a 1st-level character, which is +2.\n3 .\nD e t e r m i n e A b i l\
  \ i t y S c o r e s\nMuch of what your character does in the game depends\non his\
  \ or her six abilities: Strength, Dexterity,\nConstitution, Intelligence, Wisdom,\
  \ and Charisma.\nEach ability has a score, which is a num ber you record\non your\
  \ character sheet.\nThe six abilities and their use in the game are\ndescribed in\
  \ chapter 7.\nThe Ability S core Sum m ary\ntable provides a quick reference for\
  \ what qualities\nare m easured by each ability, what races increases\nwhich abilities,\
  \ and what classes consider each ability\nparticularly important.\nYou generate\
  \ your character's six ability scores\nrandomly.\nRoll four 6-sided dice and record\
  \ the total of\nthe highest three dice on a piece of scratch paper.\nDo\nthis five\
  \ m ore times, so that you have six numbers.\nIf\nyou want to save time or don\u2019\
  t like the idea of randomly\ndetermining ability scores, you can use the following\n\
  scores instead: 15, 14, 13, 12, 10, 8.\nNow take your six num bers and write each\
  \ number\nbeside one o f your character\u2019s six abilities to assign\nscores to\
  \ Strength, Dexterity, Constitution, Intelligence,\nW isdom , and Charisma.\nAfterward,\
  \ make any changes\nto your ability scores as a result of your race choice.\nAfter\
  \ assigning your ability scores, determine\nyour ability modifiers using the Ability\
  \ Scores and\nM odifiers table.\nTo determine an ability modifier without\nconsulting\
  \ the table, subtract 10 from the ability score\nand then divide the result by 2\
  \ (round down).\nWrite the\nmodifier next to each of your scores.\nB u i l d i n\
  \ g B r u e n o r , St e p 3\nBob decides to use the standard set of scores (15,\
  \ 14,\n13, 12, 10, 8) for Bruenor\u2019s abilities.\nSince he\u2019s a fighter,\n\
  he puts his highest score, 15, in Strength.\nHis next-\nhighest, 14, goes in Constitution.\n\
  Bruenor might be a\nbrash fighter, but Bob decides he wants the dwarf to\nbe older,\
  \ wiser, and a good leader, so he puts decent\nscores in W isdom and Charisma.\n\
  After applying his\nracial benefits (increasing Bruenor\u2019s Constitution by\n\
  2 and his Strength by 2), Bruenor\u2019s ability scores and\nmodifiers look like\
  \ this: Strength 17 (+3), Dexterity 10\n(+0), Constitution 16 (+3), Intelligence\
  \ 8 (-1), W isdom 13\n(+1), Charisma 12 (+1).\nBob fills in Bruenor's final hit\
  \ points: 10 + his\nConstitution m odifier of +3, for a total of 13 hit points.\n\
  V a r i a n t : C u s t o m i z i n g A b i l i t y S c o r e s\nAt your Dungeon\
  \ Master\u2019s option, you can use this\nvariant for determining your ability scores.\n\
  The method\ndescribed here allows you to build a character with a set\nof ability\
  \ scores you choose individually.\nYou have 27 points to spend on your ability scores.\n\
  The cost of each score is shown on the Ability Score\nPoint Cost table.\nFor example,\
  \ a score of 14 costs 7\npoints.\nUsing this method, 15 is the highest ability score\n\
  you can end up with, before applying racial increases.\nYou can\u2019t have a score\
  \ lower than 8.\nThis method of determining ability scores enables\nyou to create\
  \ a set o f three high numbers and three low\nones (15, 15, 15, 8, 8, 8), a set\
  \ o f numbers that are above\nA b i l i t y S c o r e P o i n t C o s t\nA b i l\

  \ high Strength usually corresponds\nwith a burly or athletic body, while a character\
  \ with\nlow Strength might be scrawny or plump.\nA character with high Dexterity\
  \ is probably lithe and\nslim, while a character with low Dexterity might be\neither\

  \ usually looks\nhealthy, with bright eyes and abundant energy.\nA\ncharacter with\
  \ low Constitution might be sickly or frail.\nA character with high Intelligence\
  \ might be highly\ninquisitive and studious, while a character with low\nIntelligence\
  \ might speak simply or easily forget details.\nA character with high W isdom has\
  \ good judgment,\nempathy, and a general awareness of what\u2019s going on.\nA character\
  \ with low W isdom might be absent-minded,\nfoolhardy, or oblivious.\nA character\

  \ this\nbackground gives him.\nBob has a pretty clear picture of Bruenor\u2019s\
  \ personality\nin mind, so he skips the personality traits suggested in\nthe folk\
  \ hero background, noting instead that Bruenor is\na caring, sensitive dwarf who\
  \ genuinely loves his friends\nand allies, but he hides this soft heart behind a\
  \ gruff,\nsnarling demeanor.\nHe chooses the ideal of fairness\nfrom the list in\
  \ his background, noting that Bruenor\nbelieves that no one is above the law.\n\
  Given his history, Bruenor\u2019s bond is obvious: he\naspires to som eday reclaim\
  \ Mithral Hall, his homeland,\nfrom the shadow dragon that drove the dwarves out.\n\
  His flaw is tied to his caring, sensitive nature\u2014he has a\nsoft spot for orphans\

  Things that\ncontribute to your AC include the armor you wear, the\nshield you carry,\
  \ and your Dexterity modifier.\nNot all\ncharacters w ear armor or carry shields,\
  \ however.\nWithout armor or a shield, your character\u2019s AC equals\n10 + his\
  \ or her Dexterity modifier.\nIf your character\nwears armor, carries a shield,\
  \ or both, calculate your\nAC using the rules in chapter 5.\nR ecord your AC on\n\
  your character sheet.\nYour character needs to be proficient with armor and\nshields\
  \ to w ear and use them effectively, and your armor\nand shield proficiencies are\
  \ determined by your class.\nThere are drawbacks to wearing armor or carrying a\n\
  shield if you lack the required proficiency, as explained\nin chapter 5.\nSom e\

  \u2022 For attacks with ranged weapons, use your Dexterity\nmodifier for attack\

  \ chooses a battleaxe\nand two handaxes.\nHis battleaxe is a melee weapon,\nso Bruenor\
  \ uses his Strength modifier for his attacks\nand damage.\nHis attack bonus is his\
  \ Strength modifier\n(+3) plus his proficiency bonus (+2), for a total of +5.\n\
  The battleaxe deals 1d8 slashing damage, and Bruenor\nadds his Strength modifier\
  \ to the damage when he\nhits, for a total of 1d8 + 3 slashing damage.\nW hen\n\
  throwing a handaxe, Bruenor has the same attack bonus\n(handaxes, as thrown weapons,\
  \ use Strength for attacks\nand damage), and the weapon deals 1d6 + 3 slashing\n\
  damage when it hits.\n6.\nC\no m e T o g e t h e r\nMost D & D characters don\u2019\

  \ on adventures and overcom es\nchallenges, he or she gains experience, represented\
  \ by\nexperience points.\nA character w ho reaches a specified\nexperience point\
  \ total advances in capability.\nThis\nadvancement is called gaining a level.\n\
  W hen your character gains a level, his or her class\noften grants additional features,\
  \ as detailed in the\nclass description.\nSom e of these features allow you\nto\
  \ increase your ability scores, either increasing two\nscores by 1 each or increasing\
  \ one score by 2.\nYou can\u2019t\nincrease an ability score above 20.\nIn addition,\
  \ every\ncharacter\u2019s proficiency bonus increases at certain levels.\nEach time\
  \ you gain a level, you gain 1 additional Hit\nDie.\nRoll that Hit Die, add your\
  \ Constitution modifier\nto the roll, and add the total to your hit point maximum.\n\
  Alternatively, you can use the fixed value shown in your\nclass entry, which is\
  \ the average result of the die roll\n(rounded up).\nW hen your Constitution modifier\
  \ increases by 1, your\nhit point maximum increases by 1 for each level you have\n\
  attained.\nFor example, when Bruenor reaches 8th level\nas a fighter, he increases\
  \ his Constitution score from 17\nto 18, thus increasing his Constitution modifier\
  \ from +3\nto +4.\nHis hit point maximum then increases by 8.\nThe Character Advancement\

  level 20, and the proficiency bonus for a character of that\nlevel.\nConsult the\

  \ Advancement table shows\nthe four tiers of play.\nThe tiers don\u2019t have any\
  \ rules\nassociated with them; they are a general description of how\nthe play experience\
  \ changes as characters gain levels.\nIn the first tier (levels 1-4), characters\
  \ are effectively\napprentice adventurers.\nThey are learning the features\nthat\
  \ define them as m em bers of particular classes,\nincluding the major choices that\
  \ flavor their class\nfeatures as they advance (such as a wizard\u2019s Arcane\n\
  Tradition or a fighter\u2019s Martial Archetype).\nThe threats\nthey face are relatively\
  \ minor, usually posing a danger to\nlocal farmsteads or villages.\nIn the second\
  \ tier (levels 5-10), characters com e into\ntheir own.\nMany spellcasters gain\
  \ access to 3rd-level\nspells at the start of this tier, crossing a new threshold\
  \ of\nmagical power with spells such as fireball and lightning\nbolt.\nAt this tier,\
  \ many weapon-using classes gain the\nability to make multiple attacks in one round.\n\
  These\ncharacters have becom e important, facing dangers that\nthreaten cities and\
  \ kingdoms.\nIn the third tier (levels 11-16), characters have\nreached a level\
  \ of power that sets them high above\nthe ordinary populace and makes them special\
  \ even\nam ong adventurers.\nAt 11th level, many spellcasters\ngain access to 6th-level\
  \ spells, som e of which create\neffects previously im possible for player characters\
  \ to\nachieve.\nOther characters gain features that allow them\nto make m ore attacks\
  \ or do m ore impressive things with\nthose attacks.\nThese mighty adventurers often\
  \ confront\nthreats to whole regions and continents.\nAt the fourth tier (levels\
  \ 17-20), characters achieve\nthe pinnacle of their class features, becom ing heroic\

  \ m ore com m on\nraces are the true exotics: a hulking dragonborn here,\npushing\

  \ could\nbe a good choice for a sneaky rogue, a dwarf makes a\ntough warrior, and\

  These details are suggestions to help you think about\nyour character; adventurers\

  \ can help you decide how\nold your character is at the start of the game.\nYou\n\
  can choose any age for your character, which could\nprovide an explanation for som\
  \ e of your ability scores.\nFor example, if you play a young or very old character,\n\
  your age could explain a particularly low Strength or\nConstitution score, while\
  \ advanced age could account\nfor a high Intelligence or W isdom .\nA l i g n m\
  \ e n t\nMost races have tendencies toward certain alignments,\ndescribed in this\
  \ entry.\nThese are not binding for player\ncharacters, but considering why your\
  \ dwarf is chaotic,\nfor example, in defiance of lawful dwarf society can help\n\
  you better define your character.\nS iz e\nCharacters of most races are Medium,\
  \ a size category\nincluding creatures that are roughly 4 to 8 feet tall.\nM embers\
  \ of a few races are Small (between 2 and 4 feet\ntall), which means that certain\
  \ rules of the game affect\nthem differently.\nThe m ost important o f these rules\n\
  is that Sm all characters have trouble w ielding heavy\nweapons, as explained in\
  \ chapter 6.\nS p e e d\nYour speed determines how far you can move when\ntraveling\
  \ (chapter 8) and fighting (chapter 9).\nL a n g u a g e s\nBy virtue of your race,\

  \ addition to the\ntraits specified for their subrace.\nRelationships am ong\nsubraces\
  \ vary significantly from race to race and\nworld to world.\nIn the Dragonlance\
  \ cam paign setting,\nfor example, mountain dwarves and hill dwarves live\ntogether\
  \ as different clans of the sam e people, but in\nthe Forgotten Realms, they live\
  \ far apart in separate\nkingdom s and call themselves shield dwarves and\ngold\
  \ dwarves, respectively.\nS h o r t a n d\nS t o u t\nBold and hardy, dwarves are\
  \ known as\nskilled warriors, miners, and workers\nof stone and metal.\nThough they\
  \ stand\nwell under 5 feet tall, dwarves are so\nbroad and compact that they can\
  \ weigh\nas much as a human standing nearly two\nfeet taller.\nTheir courage and\
  \ endurance\nare also easily a match for any of\nthe larger folk.\nDwarven skin\
  \ ranges from deep brown to a paler\nhue tinged with red, but the most com m on\
  \ shades are\nlight brown or deep tan, like certain tones of earth.\nTheir hair,\
  \ worn long but in simple styles, is usually\nblack, gray, or brown, though paler\
  \ dwarves often have\nred hair.\nMale dwarves value their beards highly and\ngroom\
  \ them carefully.\nL o n g M e m o r y , L o n g G r u d g e s\nDwarves can live\
  \ to be m ore than 400 years old, so the\noldest living dwarves often rem em ber\
  \ a very different\nworld.\nFor example, som e of the oldest dwarves living\nin\
  \ Citadel Felbarr (in the world of the Forgotten Realms)\ncan recall the day, m\
  \ ore than three centuries ago, when\norcs conquered the fortress and drove them\
  \ into an exile\nthat lasted over 250 years.\nThis longevity grants them a\nperspective\
  \ on the world that shorter-lived races such as\nhumans and halflings lack.\nDwarves\
  \ are solid and enduring like the mountains\nthey love, weathering the passage of\
  \ centuries with stoic\nendurance and little change.\nThey respect the traditions\n\
  of their clans, tracing their ancestry back to the\nfounding o f their m ost ancient\
  \ strongholds in the youth\nof the world, and don't abandon those traditions lightly.\n\
  Part of those traditions is devotion to the gods of the\ndwarves, w ho uphold the\
  \ dwarven ideals of industrious\nlabor, skill in battle, and devotion to the forge.\n\
  Individual dwarves are determined and loyal, true to\ntheir w ord and decisive in\
  \ action, som etim es to the point\nof stubbornness.\nMany dwarves have a strong\
  \ sense\nKingdom s rich in ancient grandeur, halls carved into the\nroots of mountains,\
  \ the echoing of picks and hamm ers\nin deep mines and blazing forges, a commitment\
  \ to\nclan and tradition, and a burning hatred of goblins and\norc s\u2014these\

  \ related dwarves,\nand invoke their ancestors\u2019 names in oaths and curses.\n\
  To be clanless is the worst fate that can befall a dwarf.\nDwarves in other lands\

  \ life might be\nmotivated by a desire for treasure\u2014for its own sake, for\n\
  a specific purpose, or even out of an altruistic desire to\nhelp others.\nOther\
  \ dwarves are driven by the com m and\nor inspiration of a deity, a direct calling\
  \ or simply a\ndesire to bring glory to one of the dwarf gods.\nClan and\nancestry\
  \ are also important motivators.\nA dwarf might\nseek to restore a clan\u2019s lost\
  \ honor, avenge an ancient\nwrong the clan suffered, or earn a new place within\
  \ the\nclan after having been exiled.\nOr a dwarf might search\nfor the axe w ielded\

  Two things to be said for them, though:\nThey don\u2019t have many smiths, but the\
  \ ones they have do very\nfine work.\nAnd when orcs or goblins come streaming down\n\
  out of the mountains, an elf\u2019s good to have at your back.\nNot\nas good as\

  them with fearful incom prehension.\nShaped by draconic\ngods or the dragons themselves,\
  \ dragonborn originally\nhatched from dragon eggs as a unique race, com bining\n\
  the best attributes of dragons and humanoids.\nSom e\ndragonborn are faithful servants\
  \ to true dragons, others\nform the ranks o f soldiers in great wars, and still\
  \ others\nfind themselves adrift, with no clear calling in life.\nP r o u d D r\
  \ a g o n K i n\nDragonborn look very much like dragons standing erect\nin humanoid\
  \ form, though they lack wings or a tail.\nThe\nfirst dragonborn had scales of vibrant\
  \ hues matching\nthe colors of their dragon kin, but generations of\ninterbreeding\
  \ have created a m ore uniform appearance.\nTheir small, fine scales are usually\
  \ brass or bronze\nin color, som etim es ranging to scarlet, rust, gold, or\ncopper-green.\n\
  They are tall and strongly built, often\nstanding close to 6 1/2 feet tall and weighing\
  \ 300 pounds\nor more.\nTheir hands and feet are strong, talonlike\nclaws with three\
  \ fingers and a thumb on each hand.\nThe blood of a particular type of dragon runs\n\
  very strong through som e dragonborn clans.\nThese\ndragonborn often boast scales\
  \ that m ore closely match\nthose of their dragon ancestor\u2014bright red, green,\

  \ or bronze.\nS e l f - S u f f i c i e n t C l a n s\nTo any dragonborn, the clan\
  \ is m ore important than\nlife itself.\nDragonborn owe their devotion and respect\n\
  to their clan above all else, even the gods.\nEach\ndragonborn\u2019s conduct reflects\
  \ on the honor of his or her\nclan, and bringing dishonor to the clan can result\
  \ in\nexpulsion and exile.\nEach dragonborn knows his or her\nstation and duties\
  \ within the clan, and honor demands\nmaintaining the bounds of that position.\n\
  A continual drive for self-improvement reflects the\nself-sufficiency of the race\
  \ as a whole.\nDragonborn value\nskill and excellence in all endeavors.\nThey hate\
  \ to fail,\nand they push themselves to extreme efforts before they\ngive up on\
  \ something.\nA dragonborn holds mastery of\na particular skill as a lifetime goal.\n\
  M embers of other\nraces w ho share the sam e commitment find it easy to\nearn the\
  \ respect o f a dragonborn.\nThough all dragonborn strive to be self-sufficient,\n\
  they recognize that help is som etim es needed in difficult\nsituations.\nBut the\
  \ best source for such help is the\nclan, and when a clan needs help, it turns to\
  \ another\ndragonborn clan before seeking aid from other races\u2014\nor even from\
  \ the gods.\nD r a g o n b o r n N a m e s\nDragonborn have personal nam es given\
  \ at birth,\nbut they put their clan names first as a mark of\nhonor.\nA childhood\

  \ likely to respond\nwith caution rather than outright fear.\nGnome.\nGnomes don\u2019\
  t look like a threat and can quickly\ndisarm suspicion with good humor.\nThe common\
  \ folk are\noften curious about gnomes, likely never having seen one\nbefore, but\
  \ they are rarely hostile or fearful.\nHalf-Elf.\nAlthough many people have never\
  \ seen a half-elf,\nvirtually everyone knows they exist.\nA half-elf stranger\u2019\
  s\narrival is followed by gossip behind the half-elf's back and\nstolen glances\
  \ across the common room, rather than any\nconfrontation or open curiosity.\nHalf-Orc.\n\
  It\u2019s usually safe to assume that a half-orc is\nbelligerent and quick to anger,\
  \ so people watch themselves\naround an unfamiliar half-orc.\nShopkeepers might\n\
  surreptitiously hide valuable or fragile goods when a half-orc\ncomes in, and people\
  \ slowly clear out of a tavern, assuming a\nfight will break out soon.\nTiefling.\n\
  Half-orcs are greeted with a practical caution, but\ntieflings are the subject of\
  \ supernatural fear.\nThe evil of their\nheritage is plainly visible in their features,\
  \ and as far as most\npeople are concerned, a tiefling could very well be a devil\n\
  straight from the Nine Hells.\nPeople might make warding\nsigns as a tiefling approaches,\

  \ the\nbroadest possible sense, they still look human.\nHowever,\ntheir infernal\
  \ heritage has left a clear imprint on their\nappearance.\nTieflings have large\
  \ horns that take any\nof a variety of shapes: som e have curling horns like a\n\
  ram, others have straight and tall horns like a gazelle\u2019s,\nand som e spiral\
  \ upward like an antelopes\u2019 horns.\nThey\nhave thick tails, four to five feet\

  Their\ncanine teeth are sharply pointed, and their eyes are\nsolid colors\u2014\
  black, red, white, silver, or gold\u2014with no\nvisible sclera or pupil.\nTheir\

  \ dark, from black or brown to dark\nred, blue, or purple.\nS e l f - R e l i a\

  \ in\nhuman cities or towns, often in the roughest quarters\nof those places, where\
  \ they grow up to be swindlers,\nthieves, or crim e lords.\nSom etim es they live\
  \ among\nother minority populations in enclaves where they are\ntreated with m ore\

  \ to trust\nanyone w ho claim s to be a friend, but when a tiefling\u2019s\ncom\

  And som e younger\ntieflings, striving to find a place in the world, adopt a\nname\

  \ tend to be suspicious of tieflings, assuming that\ntheir infernal heritage has\
  \ left its mark on their personality\nand morality, not just their appearance.\n\
  Shopkeepers keep\na close eye on their goods when tieflings enter their stores,\n\
  the town watch might follow a tiefling around for a while,\nand demagogues blame\
  \ tieflings for strange happenings.\nThe reality, though, is that a tiefling\u2019\

  \ others are virtuous.\nMost are simply\nvery aware of how people respond to them.\n\
  After dealing with\nthis mistrust throughout youth, a tiefling often develops the\n\

  A tall human tribesman strides through a blizzard,\ndraped in fur and hefting his\

  s elk herd.\nA half-orc snarls at the latest challenger to her\nauthority over their\

  \ six rivals.\nFrothing at the mouth, a dwarf slam s his helmet into\nthe face of\
  \ his drow foe, then turns to drive his armored\nelbow into the gut o f another.\n\
  These barbarians, different as they might be, are\ndefined by their rage: unbridled,\
  \ unquenchable, and\nunthinking fury.\nMore than a mere emotion, their anger\nis\
  \ the ferocity of a cornered predator, the unrelenting\nassault of a storm, the\
  \ churning turmoil o f the sea.\nFor som e, their rage springs from a com m union\n\
  with fierce animal spirits.\nOthers draw from a roiling\nreservoir of anger at a\
  \ world full of pain.\nFor every\nbarbarian, rage is a power that fuels not just\
  \ a battle\nfrenzy but also uncanny reflexes, resilience, and\nfeats of strength.\n\
  P r i m a l I n s t i n c t\nPeople of towns and cities take pride in how their\n\
  civilized ways set them apart from animals, as if\ndenying one\u2019s ow n nature\
  \ was a mark of superiority.\nTo\na barbarian, though, civilization is no virtue,\
  \ but a sign\nof weakness.\nThe strong em brace their animal nature-\nkeen instincts,\
  \ primal physicality, and ferocious rage.\nBarbarians are uncom fortable when hedged\
  \ in by walls\nand crowds.\nThey thrive in the wilds o f their homelands:\nthe tundra,\
  \ jungle, or grasslands where their tribes\nlive and hunt.\nBarbarians com e alive\
  \ in the chaos of combat.\nThey can enter a berserk state where rage takes over,\n\
  giving them superhuman strength and resilience.\nA\nbarbarian can draw on this reservoir\
  \ of fury only a few\ntimes without resting, but those few rages are usually\nsufficient\
  \ to defeat whatever threats arise.\nA L i f e o f D a n g e r\nNot every m em ber\
  \ of the tribes deem ed \u201Cbarbarians\u201D\nby scions of civilized society has\
  \ the barbarian class.\nA\ntrue barbarian am ong these people is as uncom m on as\n\
  a skilled fighter in a town, and he or she plays a similar\nrole as a protector\
  \ of the people and a leader in times\nof war.\nLife in the wild places of the world\
  \ is fraught\nwith peril: rival tribes, deadly weather, and terrifying\nmonsters.\n\
  Barbarians charge headlong into that danger\nso that their people don\u2019t have\
  \ to.\nTheir courage in the face of danger makes barbarians\nperfectly suited for\
  \ adventuring.\nW andering is often a\nway of life for their native tribes, and\
  \ the rootless life of\nthe adventurer is little hardship for a barbarian.\nSom\
  \ e\nbarbarians m iss the close-knit family structures of the\ntribe, but eventually\
  \ find them replaced by the bonds\nformed among the mem bers of their adventuring\
  \ parties.\nC r e a t i n g a B a r b a r i a n\nW hen creating a barbarian character,\
  \ think about where\nyour character com es from and his or her place in the\nworld.\n\
  Talk with your DM about an appropriate origin\nfor your barbarian.\nDid you com\
  \ e from a distant land,\nmaking you a stranger in the area of the campaign?\nOr\
  \ is the campaign set in a rough-and-tumble frontier\nwhere barbarians are com m\
  \ on?\nWhat led you to take up the adventuring life?\nW ere you\nlured to settled\
  \ lands by the prom ise of riches?\nDid you\njoin forces with soldiers of those\
  \ lands to face a shared\nthreat?\nDid monsters or an invading horde drive you\n\
  out of your homeland, making you a rootless refugee?\nPerhaps you were a prisoner\
  \ of war, brought in chains to\n\u201Ccivilized\u201D lands and only now able to\
  \ win your freedom.\nOr you might have been cast out from your people\nbecause of\
  \ a crim e you committed, a taboo you violated,\nor a coup that removed you from\

  \ proficiency bonus + your Charisma\nmodifier) or be frightened of you until the\

  \ r\nThe Path of the Totem W arrior is a spiritual journey, as\nthe barbarian accepts\
  \ a spirit animal as guide, protector,\nand inspiration.\nIn battle, your totem\
  \ spirit fills you\nwith supernatural might, adding magical fuel to your\nbarbarian\
  \ rage.\nMost barbarian tribes consider a totem animal to be\nkin to a particular\
  \ clan.\nIn such cases, it is unusual for\nan individual to have more than one totem\
  \ animal spirit,\nthough exceptions exist.\nS p i r i t S e e k e r\nYours is a\
  \ path that seeks attunement with the natural\nworld, giving you a kinship with\
  \ beasts.\nAt 3rd level when\nyou adopt this path, you gain the ability to cast\
  \ the beast\nsense and speak with animals spells, but only as rituals,\nas described\
  \ in chapter 10.\nT o t e m S p i r i t\nAt 3rd level, when you adopt this path,\
  \ you choose a\ntotem spirit and gain its feature.\nYou must make or\nacquire a\
  \ physical totem object- an amulet or similar\nadornment\u2014that incorporates\
  \ fur or feathers, claws,\nteeth, or bones of the totem animal.\nAt your option,\
  \ you\nalso gain minor physical attributes that are reminiscent\nof your totem spirit.\n\
  For example, if you have a bear\ntotem spirit, you might be unusually hairy and\
  \ thick-\nskinned, or if your totem is the eagle, your eyes turn\nbright yellow.\n\
  Your totem animal might be an animal related to those\nlisted here but m ore appropriate\
  \ to your homeland.\nFor example, you could choose a hawk or vulture in\nplace o\
  \ f an eagle.\nBear.\nW hile raging, you have resistance to all damage\nexcept psychic\
  \ damage.\nThe spirit of the bear makes you\ntough enough to stand up to any punishment.\n\
  Eagle.\nW hile you're raging and aren\u2019t wearing\nheavy armor, other creatures\
  \ have disadvantage on\nopportunity attack rolls against you, and you can use the\n\
  Dash action as a bonus action on your turn.\nThe spirit\nof the eagle m akes you\
  \ into a predator w ho can weave\nthrough the fray with ease.\nWolf, W hile you're\
  \ raging, your friends have\nadvantage on melee attack rolls against any creature\n\
  within 5 feet of you that is hostile to you.\nThe spirit of\nthe w olf makes you\
  \ a leader of hunters.\nA s p e c t o f t h e B e a s t\nAt 6th level, you gain\
  \ a m agical benefit based on the\ntotem animal of your choice.\nYou can choose\
  \ the same\nanimal you selected at 3rd level or a different one.\nBear.\nYou gain\
  \ the might of a bear.\nYour carrying\ncapacity (including maximum load and maximum\
  \ lift)\nis doubled, and you have advantage on Strength checks\nmade to push, pull,\
  \ lift, or break objects.\nEagle.\nYou gain the eyesight of an eagle.\nYou can\n\
  see up to 1 mile away with no difficulty, able to discern\neven fine details as\
  \ though looking at som ething no\nmore than 100 feet away from you.\nAdditionally,\
  \ dim\nlight doesn't im pose disadvantage on your W isdom\n(Perception) checks.\n\
  Wolf, You gain the hunting sensibilities of a wolf.\nYou\ncan track other creatures\
  \ while traveling at a fast pace,\nand you can move stealthily while traveling at\
  \ a normal\npace (see chapter 8 for rules on travel pace).\nS p i r i t W a l k\
  \ e r\nAt 10th level, you can cast the commune with nature\nspell, but only as a\
  \ ritual.\nW hen you do so, a spiritual\nversion of one of the animals you chose\
  \ for Totem Spirit\nor Aspect of the Beast appears to you to convey the\ninformation\
  \ you seek.\nT o t e m i c A t t u n e m e n t\nAt 14th level, you gain a magical\
  \ benefit based on a\ntotem animal of your choice.\nYou can choose the same\nanimal\
  \ you selected previously or a different one.\nBear, W hile you\u2019re raging,\
  \ any creature within 5 feet\no f you that\u2019s hostile to you has disadvantage\
  \ on attack\nrolls against targets other than you or another character\nwith this\
  \ feature.\nAn enemy is immune to this effect if it\ncan\u2019t see or hear you\
  \ or if it can\u2019t be frightened.\nEagle.\nW hile raging, you have a flying speed\
  \ equal to\nyour current walking speed.\nThis benefit works only in\nshort bursts;\
  \ you fall if you end your turn in the air and\nnothing else is holding you aloft.\n\
  Wolf.\nW hile you\u2019re raging, you can use a bonus action\non your turn to knock\
  \ a Large or smaller creature prone\nwhen you hit it with melee weapon attack.\n\
  In the worlds of D&D, w ords and music are\nnot just vibrations of air, but vocalizations\
  \ with\npower all their own.\nThe bard is a master of song,\nspeech, and the m agic\
  \ they contain.\nBards say\nthat the multiverse w as spoken into existence, that\
  \ the\nwords o f the gods gave it shape, and that echoes of these\nprimordial W\
  \ ords o f Creation still resound throughout\nthe cosm os.\nThe music of bards is\
  \ an attempt to snatch\nand harness those echoes, subtly woven into their\nspells\
  \ and powers.\nThe greatest strength of bards is their sheer\nversatility.\nMany\
  \ bards prefer to stick to the sidelines\nin combat, using their magic to inspire\
  \ their allies and\nhinder their foes from a distance.\nBut bards are capable\n\
  of defending themselves in melee if necessary, using\ntheir m agic to bolster their\
  \ sw ords and armor.\nTheir\nspells lean toward charm s and illusions rather than\n\
  blatantly destructive spells.\nThey have a wide-ranging\nknowledge of many subjects\
  \ and a natural aptitude\nthat lets them do almost anything well.\nBards becom e\n\
  masters of the talents they set their minds to perfecting,\nfrom musical perform\
  \ ance to esoteric knowledge.\nL e a r n i n g f r o m E x p e r i e n c e\nTrue\
  \ bards are not com m on in the world.\nNot every\nminstrel singing in a tavern\
  \ or jester cavorting in a royal\ncourt is a bard.\nDiscovering the magic hidden\
  \ in music\nrequires hard study and som e measure of natural talent\nthat most troubadours\
  \ and jongleurs lack.\nIt can be hard\nto spot the difference between these perform\
  \ ers and true\nbards, though.\nA bard\u2019s life is spent wandering across\nthe\
  \ land gathering lore, telling stories, and living on the\ngratitude of audiences,\
  \ much like any other entertainer.\nBut a depth of knowledge, a level of musical\
  \ skill, and a\ntouch of magic set bards apart from their fellows.\nOnly rarely\
  \ do bards settle in one place for long, and\ntheir natural desire to travel\u2014\
  to find new tales to tell,\nnew skills to learn, and new discoveries beyond the\n\
  horizon\u2014makes an adventuring career a natural calling.\nEvery adventure is\
  \ an opportunity to learn, practice a\nvariety of skills, enter long-forgotten tombs,\
  \ discover lost\nBa r d\nHumming as she traces her fingers over an ancient\nmonument\
  \ in a long-forgotten ruin, a half-elf in rugged\nleathers finds knowledge springing\
  \ into her mind,\nconjured forth by the magic of her song\u2014knowledge\nof the\
  \ people who constructed the monument and the\nmythic saga it depicts.\nA stern\
  \ human warrior bangs his sword rhythmically\nagainst his scale mail, setting the\
  \ tempo for his war chant\nand exhorting his com panions to bravery and heroism.\n\
  The magic of his song fortifies and em boldens them.\nLaughing as she tunes her\
  \ cittern, a gnom e weaves\nher subtle magic over the assem bled nobles, ensuring\n\
  that her com panions\u2019 words will be well received.\nW hether scholar, skald,\
  \ or scoundrel, a bard weaves\nmagic through w ords and music to inspire allies,\n\
  dem oralize foes, manipulate minds, create\nillusions, and even heal wounds.\nM\
  \ u s i c a n d M a g i c\nworks of magic, decipher old tomes, travel to strange\n\
  places, or encounter exotic creatures.\nBards love to\naccom pany heroes to witness\
  \ their deeds firsthand.\nA\nbard who can tell an awe-inspiring story from personal\n\
  experience earns renown am ong other bards.\nIndeed,\nafter telling so many stories\
  \ about heroes accom plishing\nmighty deeds, many bards take these themes to heart\n\
  and assume heroic roles themselves.\nP r o f i c i e n c i e s\nArmor: Light armor\n\
  Weapons: Simple weapons, hand crossbow s,\nlongswords, rapiers, shortswords\nTools:\
  \ Three musical instruments of your choice\nSaving Throws: Dexterity, Charisma\n\
  Skills: Choose any three\nC r e a t i n g a B a r d\nBards thrive on stories, whether\
  \ those stories are true\nor not.\nYour character\u2019s background and motivations\n\
  are not as important as the stories that he or she tells\nabout them.\nPerhaps you\
  \ had a secure and mundane\nchildhood.\nThere\u2019s no good story to be told about\
  \ that,\nso you might paint yourself as an orphan raised by a hag\nin a dismal swamp.\n\
  Or your childhood might be worthy\nof a story.\nSom e bards acquire their magical\
  \ music\nthrough extraordinary means, including the inspiration\nof fey or other\
  \ supernatural creatures.\nDid you serve an apprenticeship, studying under a\nmaster,\
  \ following the m ore experienced bard until you\nwere ready to strike out on your\
  \ own?\nOr did you attend\na college where you studied bardic lore and practiced\n\
  your musical magic?\nPerhaps you were a young runaway\nor orphan, befriended by\
  \ a wandering bard w ho becam e\nyour mentor.\nOr you might have been a spoiled\
  \ noble\nchild tutored by a master.\nPerhaps you stumbled into the\nclutches of\
  \ a hag, making a bargain for a musical gift in\naddition to your life and freedom,\
  \ but at what cost?\nE q u i p m e n t\nYou start with the following equipment,\
  \ in addition to\nthe equipment granted by your background:\n\u2022 (a) a rapier,\
  \ (b) a longsword, or (c) any simple weapon\n\u2022 (a) a diplomat\u2019s pack or\

  \ untangle and reshape the fabric of\nreality in harmony with your wishes and music.\n\
  Your\nspells are part of your vast repertoire, magic that you\ncan tune to different\
  \ situations.\nS ee chapter 10 for the\ngeneral rules of spellcasting and chapter\
  \ 11 for the\nbard spell list.\nC a n t r i p s\nYou know two cantrips of your choice\
  \ from the bard\nspell list.\nYou learn additional bard cantrips of your\nchoice\
  \ at higher levels, as shown in the Cantrips Known\ncolum n of the Bard table.\n\
  C lass F e a t u r e s\nAs a bard, you gain the following class features.\nH i t\

  \ per bard level after 1st\nQ u i c k B u i l d\nYou can make a bard quickly by\n\
  following these suggestions.\nFirst,\nCharisma should be your highest\nability score,\
  \ followed by Dexterity.\nSecond, choose the entertainer\nbackground.\nThird, choose\
  \ the dancing lights and\nvicious mockery cantrips, along with the following\n1st-level\
  \ spells: charm person, detect magic, healing\nword, and thunderwave.\nS p e l l\
  \ S l o t s\nThe Bard table shows how many spell slots you have to\ncast your spells\
  \ of 1st level and higher.\nTo cast one of\nthese spells, you must expend a slot\
  \ of the spell\u2019s level\nor higher.\nYou regain all expended spell slots when\
  \ you\nfinish a long rest.\nFor example, if you know the 1st-level spell cure\n\
  wounds and have a 1st-level and a 2nd-level spell slot\navailable, you can cast\
  \ cure wounds using either slot.\nS p e l l s K n o w n o f 1s t L e v e l a n d\
  \ H i g h e r\nYou know four 1st-level spells of your choice from the\nbard spell\

  \ bard spells of your choice.\nEach of\nthese spells must be of a level for which\
  \ you have spell\nslots, as shown on the table.\nFor instance, when you\nreach 3rd\
  \ level in this class, you can learn one new spell\nof 1st or 2nd level.\nAdditionally,\
  \ when you gain a level in this class, you\ncan choose one of the bard spells you\
  \ know and replace\nit with another spell from the bard spell list, which also\n\
  must be of a level for which you have spell slots.\nS p e l l c a s t i n g A b\
  \ i l i t y\nCharisma is your spellcasting ability for your bard\nspells.\nYour\
  \ magic com es from the heart and soul you\npour into the perform ance of your music\
  \ or oration.\nYou use your Charisma whenever a spell refers to your\nspellcasting\
  \ ability.\nIn addition, you use your Charisma\nmodifier when setting the saving\
  \ throw DC for a bard\nspell you cast and when making an attack roll with one.\n\
  Spell save DC = 8 + your proficiency bonus +\nyour Charisma modifier\nSpell attack\

  To do so, you use a bonus action on your turn to choose\none creature other than\

  \ m em bers might find themselves\nquestioning everything they held to be true,\

  \ than politic.\nThe college\u2019s m em bers gather in libraries and\nsom etim\

  check, or a damage roll, you can use your reaction to\nexpend one of your uses of\

  \ chosen to fulfill a high calling.\nHarnessing divine magic doesn\u2019t rely on\
  \ study or\ntraining.\nA cleric might learn formulaic prayers and\nancient rites,\
  \ but the ability to cast cleric spells relies on\ndevotion and an intuitive sense\
  \ o f a deity\u2019s wishes.\nClerics com bine the helpful magic o f healing and\n\
  inspiring their allies with spells that harm and hinder\nfoes.\nThey can provoke\
  \ awe and dread, lay curses of\nplague or poison, and even call down flames from\
  \ heaven\nto consum e their enemies.\nFor those evildoers who will\nbenefit most\

  \ n t s\nNot every acolyte or officiant at a temple or shrine is a\ncleric.\nSom\
  \ e priests are called to a simple life o f temple\nservice, carrying out their\

  \ with a god at all.\nTrue clerics\nare rare in most hierarchies.\nW hen a cleric\
  \ takes up an adventuring life, it is usually\nbecause his or her god demands it.\n\
  Pursuing the goals\nof the gods often involves braving dangers beyond the\nwalls\
  \ of civilization, smiting evil or seeking holy relics in\nancient tombs.\nMany\
  \ clerics are also expected to protect\ntheir deities\u2019 worshipers, which can\
  \ mean fighting\nrampaging orc s, negotiating peace between warring\nnations, or\

  \ entity, while others\nserve gods o f wild nature, animals, or elemental forces.\n\
  The ancient druidic traditions are som etim es called\nthe Old Faith, in contrast\

  \ nature and anim als\u2014\nthe power of tooth and claw, of sun and m oon, of fire\n\
  and storm.\nDruids also gain the ability to take on animal\nforms, and som e druids\

  \ animal\nform to their natural form.\nP r e s e r v e t h e B a l a n c e\nFor\
  \ druids, nature exists in a precarious balance.\nThe\nfour elements that make up\
  \ a w orld\u2014air, earth, fire,\nand water\u2014must remain in equilibrium.\n\
  If one element\nwere to gain power over the others, the world could be\ndestroyed,\
  \ drawn into one of the elemental planes and\nbroken apart into its com ponent elements.\n\
  Thus, druids\noppose cults of Elemental Evil and others who promote\none element\
  \ to the exclusion of others.\nDruids are also concerned with the delicate ecological\n\
  balance that sustains plant and animal life, and the need\nfor civilized folk to\
  \ live in harmony with nature, not in\nopposition to it.\nDruids accept that which\
  \ is cruel in\nnature, and they hate that which is unnatural, including\naberrations\
  \ (such as beholders and mind flayers)\nand undead (such as zom bies and vampires).\n\
  Druids\nsom etim es lead raids against such creatures, especially\nwhen the monsters\
  \ encroach on the druids\u2019 territory.\nDruids are often found guarding sacred\
  \ sites or\nwatching over regions of unspoiled nature.\nBut when a\nsignificant\
  \ danger arises, threatening nature\u2019s balance\nor the lands they protect, druids\
  \ take on a m ore active\nrole in com bating the threat, as adventurers.\nC r e\
  \ a t i n g a D r u i d\nW hen making a druid, consider why your character has\n\
  such a close bond with nature.\nPerhaps your character\nlives in a society where\
  \ the Old Faith still thrives, or was\nraised by a druid after being abandoned in\
  \ the depths\nof a forest.\nPerhaps your character had a dramatic\nencounter with\

  \ and surviving the\nexperience.\nMaybe your character w as born during an\nepic\

  as part of your druidic calling, or did you\nfirst spend time as a caretaker of\

  To cast one of\nthese druid spells, you must expend a slot of the spell\u2019s\n\

  You prepare the list of druid spells that are available\nfor you to cast, choosing\

  \ l a n t s a n d W o o d\nA druid holds certain plants to be sacred, particularly\

  \ and yew.\nDruids often use such plants as part of a\nspellcasting focus, incorporating\
  \ lengths of oak or yew or\nsprigs of mistletoe.\nSimilarly, a druid uses such woods\
  \ to make other objects,\nsuch as weapons and shields.\nYew is associated with death\n\
  and rebirth, so weapon handles for scimitars or sickles might\nbe fashioned from\
  \ it.\nAsh is associated with life and oak\nwith strength.\nThese woods make excellent\
  \ hafts or whole\nweapons, such as clubs or quarterstaffs, as well as shields.\n\
  Alder is associated with air, and it might be used for thrown\nweapons, such as\
  \ darts or javelins.\nDruids from regions that lack the plants described here\n\
  have chosen other plants to take on similar uses.\nFor\ninstance, a druid of a desert\
  \ region might value the yucca\ntree and cactus plants.\none spell).\nThe spells\
  \ must be of a level for which you\nhave spell slots.\nFor example, if you are a\
  \ 3rd-level druid, you have four\n1st-level and two 2nd-level spell slots.\nWith\
  \ a W isdom\nof 16, your list of prepared spells can include six spells\nof 1st\
  \ or 2nd level, in any combination.\nIf you prepare\nthe 1st-level spell cure wounds,\
  \ you can cast it using\na 1st-level or 2nd-level slot.\nCasting the spell doesn\u2019\
  t\nremove it from your list of prepared spells.\nYou can also change your list of\
  \ prepared spells when\nyou finish a long rest.\nPreparing a new list of druid\n\
  spells requires time spent in prayer and meditation: at\nleast 1 minute per spell\
  \ level for each spell on your list.\nS p e l l c a s t i n g A b i l i t y\nW isdom\
  \ is your spellcasting ability for your druid\nspells, since your m agic draws upon\
  \ your devotion and\nattunement to nature.\nYou use your W isdom whenever\na spell\
  \ refers to your spellcasting ability.\nIn addition,\nyou use your W isdom modifier\
  \ when setting the saving\nthrow DC for a druid spell you cast and when making an\n\
  attack roll with one.\nSpell save DC = 8 + your proficiency bonus +\nyour Wisdom\

  \ use your action to\nmagically assume the shape of a beast that you have\nseen\

  \ a short or long rest.\nYour druid level determines the beasts you can\ntransform\
  \ into, as shown in the Beast Shapes table.\nAt\n2nd level, for example, you can\

  \ shape for a number o f hours\nequal to half your druid level (rounded down).\n\
  You then\nrevert to your normal form unless you expend another\nuse of this feature.\n\
  You can revert to your normal\nform earlier by using a bonus action on your turn.\n\
  You\nautomatically revert if you fall unconscious, drop to\n0 hit points, or die.\n\
  W hile you are transformed, the following rules apply:\n\u2022 Your game statistics\
  \ are replaced by the statistics of\nthe beast, but you retain your alignment, personality,\n\
  and Intelligence, W isdom , and Charisma scores.\nYou\nalso retain all of your skill\
  \ and saving throw proficien-\ncies, in addition to gaining those of the creature.\n\
  If\nthe creature has the same proficiency as you and the\nbonus in its stat block\
  \ is higher than yours, use the\ncreature\u2019s bonus instead of yours.\nIf the\
  \ creature has\nany legendary or lair actions, you can't use them.\n\u2022 W hen\
  \ you transform, you assume the beast\u2019s hit\npoints and Hit Dice.\nW hen you\
  \ revert to your normal\nform, you return to the number of hit points you had\n\
  before you transformed.\nHowever, if you revert as a\nresult of dropping to 0 hit\
  \ points, any excess damage\ncarries over to your normal form.\nFor example, if\
  \ you\ntake 10 damage in animal form and have only 1 hit\npoint left, you revert\
  \ and take 9 damage.\nA s long as\nthe excess damage doesn\u2019t reduce your normal\
  \ form\nto 0 hit points, you aren\u2019t knocked unconscious.\n\u2022 You can\u2019\
  t cast spells, and your ability to speak or\ntake any action that requires hands\
  \ is limited to the\ncapabilities of your beast form.\nTransforming doesn\u2019\
  t\nbreak your concentration on a spell you\u2019ve already\ncast, however, or prevent\
  \ you from taking actions that\nare part of a spell, such as call lightning, that\
  \ you\u2019ve\nalready cast.\n\u2022 You retain the benefit of any features from\
  \ your class,\nrace, or other source and can use them if the new\nform is physically\
  \ capable of doing so.\nHowever, you\ncan\u2019t use any o f your special senses,\
  \ such as darkvi-\nsion, unless your new form also has that sense.\n\u2022 You choose\
  \ whether your equipment falls to the\nground in your space, merges into your new\
  \ form, or\nis worn by it.\nW orn equipment functions as normal,\nbut the DM decides\
  \ whether it is practical for the new\nform to wear a piece of equipment, based\
  \ on the crea-\nture\u2019s shape and size.\nYour equipment doesn\u2019t change\n\
  size or shape to match the new\nform, and any equipment that\nthe new form can\u2019\
  t w ear\nmust either fall to the\nground or merge with it.\nEquipment that merges\n\
  with the form has no\neffect until you leave\nthe form.\nD r u i d C i r c l e\n\
  At 2nd level, you choose to\nidentify with a circle of druids:\nthe Circle of the\
  \ Land or the Circle of the M oon, both\ndetailed at the end of the class description.\n\
  Your choice\ngrants you features at 2nd level and again at 6th, 10th,\nand 14th\
  \ level.\nA b i l i t y S c o r e I m p r o v e m e n t\nW hen you reach 4th level,\
  \ and again at 8th, 12th, 16th,\nand 19th level, you can increase one ability score\
  \ of\nyour choice by 2, or you can increase two ability scores\nof your choice by\
  \ 1.\nAs normal, you can\u2019t increase an\nability score above 20 using this feature.\n\
  Starting at 18th level, the primal magic that you wield\ncauses you to age m ore\
  \ slowly.\nFor every 10 years that\npass, your body ages only 1 year.\nB e a s t\
  \ S p e l l s\nBeginning at 18th level, you can cast many of your druid\nspells\
  \ in any shape you assume using W ild Shape.\nYou\ncan perform the som atic and\
  \ verbal com ponents of a\ndruid spell while in a beast shape, but you aren\u2019\
  t able to\nprovide material com ponents.\nA r c h d r u i d\nAt 20th level, you\
  \ can use your W ild Shape an unlimited\nnum ber of times.\nT i m e l e s s B o\
  \ d y\nAdditionally, you can ignore the verbal and somatic\ncom ponents of your\
  \ druid spells, as well as any material\ncom ponents that lack a cost and aren\u2019\
  t consum ed by a\nspell.\nYou gain this benefit in both your normal shape\nand your\
  \ beast shape from W ild Shape.\nD r u id C ircles\nThough their organization is\
  \ invisible to most outsiders,\ndruids are part of a society that spans the land,\
  \ ignoring\npolitical borders.\nAll druids are nominally m em bers\nof this druidic\
  \ society, though som e individuals are so\nisolated that they have never seen any\
  \ high-ranking\nm em bers of the society or participated in druidic\ngatherings.\n\
  Druids recognize each other as brothers and\nsisters.\nLike creatures of the wilderness,\
  \ however, druids\nsom etim es compete with or even prey on each other.\nAt a local\
  \ scale, druids are organized into circles that\nshare certain perspectives on nature,\
  \ balance, and the\nway o f the druid.\nC i r c l e o f t h e L a n d\nThe Circle\
  \ of the Land is made up of mystics and sages\nwho safeguard ancient knowledge and\
  \ rites through\na vast oral tradition.\nThese druids meet within sacred\ncircles\
  \ of trees or standing stones to whisper primal\nsecrets in Druidic.\nThe circle\u2019\
  s w isest m em bers preside\nas the chief priests of communities that hold to the\
  \ Old\nFaith and serve as advisors to the rulers of those folk.\nAs a m em ber of\
  \ this circle, your magic is influenced\nby the land where you were initiated into\
  \ the circle\u2019s\nmysterious rites.\nB o n u s C a n t r i p\nW hen you choose\
  \ this circle at 2nd level, you learn one\nadditional druid cantrip of your choice.\n\
  N a t u r a l R e c o v e r y\nStarting at 2nd level, you can regain som e of your\n\
  magical energy by sitting in meditation and com m uning\nwith nature.\nDuring a\
  \ short rest, you choose expended\nspell slots to recover.\nThe spell slots can\
  \ have a\ncom bined level that is equal to or less than half your\ndruid level (rounded\
  \ up), and none of the slots can be\n6th level or higher.\nYou can\u2019t use this\
  \ feature again until\nyou finish a long rest\nFor example, when you are a 4th-level\
  \ druid, you can\nrecover up to two levels w orth of spell slots.\nYou can\nrecover\
  \ either a 2nd-level slot or two 1st-level slots.\nC i r c l e S p e l l s\nYour\
  \ mystical connection to the land infuses you with\nthe ability to cast certain\
  \ spells.\nAt 3rd, 5th, 7th, and\n9th level you gain access to circle spells connected\n\
  to the land where you becam e a druid.\nC hoose that\nland\u2014arctic, coast, desert,\
  \ forest, grassland, mountain,\nswamp, or Underdark\u2014and consult the associated\n\
  list of spells.\nOnce you gain access to a circle spell, you always have\nit prepared,\
  \ and it doesn\u2019t count against the number of\nspells you can prepare each day.\n\

  \ you have learned to use magic to alter\nyour physical form in m ore subtle ways.\n\
  You can cast the\nalter self spell at will.\nD r u i d s a n d t h e G o d s\nSome\
  \ druids venerate the forces of nature themselves, but\nmost druids are devoted\
  \ to one of the many nature deities\nworshiped in the multiverse (the lists of gods\
  \ in appendix\nB include many such deities).\nThe worship of these deities\nis often\
  \ considered a more ancient tradition than the faiths\nof clerics and urbanized\
  \ peoples.\nIn fact, in the world of\nGreyhawk, the druidic faith is called the\
  \ Old Faith, and it\nclaims many adherents among farmers, foresters, fishers,\n\
  and others who live closely with nature.\nThis tradition\nincludes the worship of\
  \ Nature as a primal force beyond\npersonification, but also encompasses the worship\
  \ of Beory,\nthe Oerth Mother, as well as devotees of Obad-Hai, Ehlonna,\nand Ulaa.\n\
  In the worlds of Greyhawk and the Forgotten Realms,\ndruidic circles are not usually\
  \ connected to the faith of a\nsingle nature deity.\nAny given circle in the Forgotten\
  \ Realms,\nfor example, might include druids who revere Silvanus,\nMielikki, Eldath,\
  \ Chauntea, or even the harsh Gods of Fury:\nTalos, Malar, Auril, and Umberlee.\n\
  These nature gods are\noften called the First Circle, the first among the druids,\
  \ and\nmost druids count them all (even the violent ones) as worthy\nof veneration.\n\
  The druids of Eberron hold animistic beliefs completely\nunconnected to the Sovereign\
  \ Host, the Dark Six, or any of\nthe other religions of the world.\nThey believe\
  \ that every living\nthing and every natural phenomenon\u2014 sun, moon, wind,\n\
  fire, and the world itself\u2014has a spirit.\nTheir spells, then, are\na means\
  \ to communicate with and command these spirits.\nDifferent druidic sects, though,\
  \ hold different philosophies\nabout the proper relationship of these spirits to\
  \ each other\nand to the forces of civilization.\nThe Ashbound, for example,\nbelieve\
  \ that arcane magic is an abomination against nature,\nthe Children of Winter venerate\
  \ the forces of death, and the\nGatekeepers preserve ancient traditions meant to\
  \ protect the\nworld from the incursion of aberrations.\nF i g h t e r\nA human\
  \ in clanging plate armor holds her shield\nbefore her as she runs toward the m\
  \ assed goblins.\nAn\nelf behind her, clad in studded leather armor, peppers\nthe\
  \ goblins with arrows loosed from his exquisite\nbow.\nThe half-orc nearby shouts\
  \ orders, helping\nthe two combatants coordinate their assault to the\nbest advantage.\n\
  A dwarf in chain mail interposes his shield between\nthe ogre\u2019s club and his\
  \ com panion, knocking the deadly\nblow aside.\nHis companion, a half-elf in scale\
  \ armor,\nswings two scim itars in a blinding whirl as she circles\nthe ogre, looking\

  \ for the crow d\u2019s delight\u2014and his own\ntactical advantage.\nHis opponent\u2019\

  \ knights, conquering overlords, royal\nchampions, elite foot soldiers, hardened\
  \ mercenaries,\nand bandit kings\u2014as fighters, they all share an\nunparalleled\
  \ mastery with w eapons and armor, and a\nthorough knowledge of the skills of combat.\n\
  And they\nare well acquainted with death, both meting it out and\nstaring it defiantly\

  \ in a\ncertain style of combat.\nSom e concentrate on archery,\nsom e on fighting\
  \ with two w eapons at once, and som e\non augmenting their martial skills with\

  \ to create magical\neffects and exceed their bodies' physical capabilities,\nand\

  Using this energy, m onks channel\nuncanny speed and strength into their unarm ed\

  \ the\nattack and damage rolls o f your unarmed strikes and\nm onk weapons.\n\u2022\
  \ You can roll a d4 in place of the normal damage\nof your unarm ed strike or m\

  \ Arts colum n of the M onk table.\n\u2022 W hen you use the Attack action with\
  \ an unarmed\nstrike or a m onk w eapon on your turn, you can make\none unarmed\

  \ with a quarter-\nstaff, you can also make an unarmed strike as a bonus\naction,\
  \ assum ing you haven't already taken a bonus\naction this turn.\nCertain m onasteries\
  \ use specialized form s of the\nm onk weapons.\nFor example, you might use a club\n\
  that is two lengths of w ood connected by a short chain\n(called a nunchaku) or\
  \ a sickle with a shorter, straighter\nblade (called a kama).\nWhatever name you\
  \ use for a\nm onk weapon, you can use the game statistics provided\nfor the weapon\
  \ in chapter 5.\nK i\nStarting at 2nd level, your training allows you to\nharness\
  \ the mystic energy of ki.\nYour access to this\nenergy is represented by a number\
  \ of ki points.\nYour\nm onk level determines the number of points you have,\nas\

  \ meditating to\nregain your ki points.\nSom e of your ki features require your\

  Starting at 3rd level, you can use your reaction to\ndeflect or catch the missile\
  \ when you are hit by a ranged\nweapon attack.\nW hen you do so, the damage you\
  \ take\nfrom the attack is reduced by 1d 10 + your Dexterity\nmodifier + your m\

  \ small enough for you to hold in one hand\nand you have at least one hand free.\n\
  If you catch a\nmissile in this way, you can spend 1 ki point to make a\nranged\
  \ attack with the weapon or piece of ammunition\nyou just caught, as part of the\

  All three\ntraditions rely on the sam e basic techniques, diverging\nas the student\

  \ a multitude of monasteries\nand monastic traditions.\nIn lands with an Asian cultural\n\
  flavor, such as Shou Lung far to the east of the Forgotten\nRealms, these monasteries\
  \ are associated with philosophical\ntraditions and martial arts practice.\nThe\
  \ Iron Hand School,\nthe Five Stars School, the Northern Fist School, and\nthe Southern\
  \ Star School of Shou Lung teach different\napproaches to the physical, mental,\
  \ and spiritual disciplines\nof the monk.\nSome of these monasteries have spread\
  \ to the\nwestern lands of Faerun, particularly in places with large\nShou immigrant\
  \ communities, such as Thesk and Westgate.\nOther monastic traditions are associated\
  \ with deities who\nteach the value of physical excellence and mental discipline.\n\
  In the Forgotten Realms, the order of the Dark Moon is\nmade up of monks dedicated\
  \ to Shar (goddess of loss), who\nmaintain secret communities in remote hills, back\
  \ allies,\nand subterranean hideaways.\nMonasteries of Ilmater (god\nof endurance)\
  \ are named after flowers, and their orders\ncarry the names of great heroes of\
  \ the faith; the Disciples of\nSaint Sollars the Twice-Martyred reside in the Monastery\
  \ of\nthe Yellow Rose near Damara.\nThe monasteries of Eberron\ncombine the study\
  \ of martial arts with a life of scholarship.\nMost are devoted to the deities of\
  \ the Sovereign Host.\nIn the world of Dragonlance, most monks are devoted to\n\
  Majere, god of meditation and thought.\nIn Greyhawk, many\nmonasteries are dedicated\
  \ to Xan Yae, the goddess of twilight\nand the superiority of mind over matter,\
  \ or to Zuoken, god of\nmental and physical mastery.\nThe evil monks of the Scarlet\
  \ Brotherhood in the world of\nGreyhawk derive their fanatic zeal not from devotion\
  \ to a god\nbut from dedication to the principles of their nation and their\nrace\u2014\
  \ the belief that the Suel strand of humanity are meant\nto rule the world.\nPa\

  \ paladins are\nunited by their oaths to stand against the forces of evil.\nW hether\
  \ sworn before a god\u2019s altar and the witness of\na priest, in a sacred glade\
  \ before nature spirits and fey\nbeings, or in a moment of desperation and grief\
  \ with the\ndead as the only witness, a paladin\u2019s oath is a powerful\nbond.\n\
  It is a source of power that turns a devout warrior\ninto a blessed champion.\n\
  T h e C a u s e o f R i g h t e o u s n e s s\nA paladin swears to uphold justice\
  \ and righteousness,\nto stand with the good things of the world against the\nencroaching\
  \ darkness, and to hunt the forces of evil\nwherever they lurk.\nDifferent paladins\
  \ focus on various\naspects of the cause of righteousness, but all are\nbound by\
  \ the oaths that grant them power to do their\nsacred work.\nAlthough many paladins\
  \ are devoted to\ngods of good, a paladin\u2019s power com es as much from a\ncommitment\
  \ to justice itself as it does from a god.\nPaladins train for years to learn the\
  \ skills o f combat,\nmastering a variety o f w eapons and armor.\nEven so,\ntheir\
  \ martial skills are secondary to the magical power\nthey wield: power to heal the\

  \ f the gods?\nOr are you an embittered\nloner sworn to take vengeance on those\

  \ your need for revenge?\nAppendix B lists many deities\nworshiped by paladins throughout\

  \ have known from your earliest\nm em ories that the paladin\u2019s life was your\
  \ calling, almost\nas if you had been sent into the world with that purpose\nstamped\
  \ on your soul.\nAs guardians against the forces of wickedness,\npaladins are rarely\
  \ of any evil alignment.\nM ost of them\nwalk the paths of charity and justice.\n\
  Consider how your\nalignment colors the way you pursue your holy quest\nand the\

  \ is the culmination\nof all the paladin\u2019s training.\nSom e characters with\
  \ this\nclass don\u2019t consider themselves true paladins until\nthey have reached\
  \ 3rd level and made this oath.\nFor\nothers, the actual swearing of the oath is\
  \ a formality,\nan official stamp on what has always been true in the\npaladin\u2019\
  s heart.\nO a t h o f D e v o t i o n\nThe Oath of Devotion binds a paladin to the\
  \ loftiest\nideals of justice, virtue, and order.\nSom etim es called\ncavaliers,\
  \ white knights, or holy warriors, these\npaladins meet the ideal of the knight\
  \ in shining armor,\nacting with honor in pursuit o f justice and the greater\n\
  good.\nThey hold themselves to the highest standards of\nconduct, and som e, for\
  \ better or w orse, hold the rest of\nthe world to the same standards.\nMany who\
  \ swear this\noath are devoted to gods of law and good and use their\ngods\u2019\
  \ tenets as the measure o f their devotion.\nThey hold\nangels\u2014the perfect\
  \ servants o f good\u2014as their ideals,\nand incorporate im ages of angelic wings\

  \ w ho have just authority over you.\nO a t h S p e l l s\nYou gain oath spells\
  \ at the paladin levels listed.\nB r e a k i n g Y o u r O a t h\nA paladin tries\
  \ to hold to the highest standards of conduct,\nbut even the most virtuous paladin\
  \ is fallible.\nSometimes\nthe right path proves too demanding, sometimes a situation\n\
  calls for the lesser of two evils, and sometimes the heat of\nemotion causes a paladin\
  \ to transgress his or her oath.\nA paladin who has broken a vow typically seeks\
  \ absolution\nfrom a cleric who shares his or her faith or from another\npaladin\
  \ of the same order.\nThe paladin might spend an all-\nnight vigil in prayer as\

  into thieves\u2019 guilds or crim e families.\nPlenty of rogues\noperate independently,\
  \ but even they som etim es\nrecruit apprentices to help them in their scam s\n\
  and heists.\nA few rogues make an honest living as\nR o g u e\nS k i l l a n d P\

  \ with\ninherent magic but perhaps scarred as well?\nHow do you feel about the magical\
  \ power coursing\nthrough you?\nD o you em brace it, try to master it, or\nrevel\
  \ in its unpredictable nature?\nIs it a blessing or\na curse?\nDid you seek it out,\
  \ or did it find you?\nDid\nyou have the option to refuse it, and do you wish you\n\
  had?\nW hat do you intend to do with it?\nPerhaps you\nfeel like you\u2019ve been\
  \ given this power for som e lofty\npurpose.\nOr you might decide that the power\
  \ gives you\nthe right to do what you want, to take what you want\nfrom those who\
  \ lack such power.\nPerhaps your power\nlinks you to a powerful individual in the\
  \ world\u2014the fey\ncreature that blessed you at birth, the dragon who put\na\
  \ drop of its blood into your veins, the lich who created\nyou as an experiment,\
  \ or the deity who chose you to\ncarry this power.\nQ u i c k B u i l d\nYou can\

  \ draconic m agic that was\nmingled with your blood or that o f your ancestors.\n\
  Most\noften, sorcerers with this origin trace their descent\nback to a mighty sorcerer\
  \ of ancient times w ho made a\nbargain with a dragon or who might even have claimed\n\
  a dragon parent.\nSom e of these bloodlines are well\nestablished in the world,\
  \ but most are obscure.\nAny\ngiven sorcerer could be the first of a new bloodline,\
  \ as a\nresult of a pact or som e other exceptional circumstance.\nD r a g o n A\

  E l e m e n t a l A f f i n i t y\nStarting at 6th level, when you cast a spell\

  spell), each hostile creature that starts its turn in this\naura must succeed on\
  \ a W isdom saving throw or be\ncharm ed (if you chose awe) or frightened (if you\
  \ chose\nfear) until the aura ends.\nA creature that succeeds on\nthis saving throw\
  \ is immune to your aura for 24 hours.\nW i l d M a g i c\nYour innate magic com\
  \ es from the wild forces of chaos\nthat underlie the order of creation.\nYou might\
  \ have\nendured exposure to som e form o f raw magic, perhaps\nthrough a planar\

  Perhaps you\nwere blessed by a powerful fey creature or marked by a\ndemon.\nOr\

  \ served by clerics.\nMore often, though, the\narrangement is similar to that between\
  \ a master and\nan apprentice.\nThe warlock learns and grows in power,\nat the cost\

  \ on a w arlock ranges from minor\nbut lasting alterations to the warlock's being\
  \ (such as\nthe ability to see in darkness or to read any language)\nto access to\
  \ powerful spells.\nUnlike bookish wizards,\nw arlocks supplement their magic with\

  \u2022 A spellbook\nS p e l l c a s t i n g\nAs a student o f arcane magic, you\
  \ have a spellbook\ncontaining spells that show the first glimm erings of\nyour\
  \ true power.\nSee chapter 10 for the general rules of\nspellcasting and chapter\
  \ 11 for the wizard spell list.\nC a n t r i p s\nAt 1st level, you know three cantrips\
  \ of your choice\nfrom the wizard spell list.\nYou learn additional wizard\ncantrips\
  \ of your choice at higher levels, as shown in the\nCantrips Known colum n of the\
  \ W izard table.\nY o u r S p e l l b o o k\nThe spells that you add to your spellbook\
  \ as you gain levels\nreflect the arcane research you conduct on your own, as well\n\
  as intellectual breakthroughs you have had about the nature\nof the multiverse.\n\
  You might find other spells during your\nadventures.\nYou could discover a spell\
  \ recorded on a scroll in\nan evil wizard's chest, for example, or in a dusty tome\
  \ in an\nancient library.\nCopying a Spell into the Book.\nWhen you find a wizard\
  \ spell\nof 1st level or higher, you can add it to your spellbook if it is\nof a\
  \ level for which you have spell slots and if you can spare\nthe time to decipher\
  \ and copy it.\nCopying a spell into your spellbook involves reproducing\nthe basic\
  \ form of the spell, then deciphering the unique\nsystem of notation used by the\
  \ wizard who wrote it.\nYou\nmust practice the spell until you understand the sounds\n\
  or gestures required, then transcribe it into your spellbook\nusing your own notation.\n\
  For each level of the spell, the process takes 2 hours and\ncosts 50 gp.\nThe cost\
  \ represents material components you\nexpend as you experiment with the spell to\
  \ master it, as well\nas the fine inks you need to record it.\nOnce you have spent\n\
  this time and money, you can prepare the spell just like your\nother spells.\nReplacing\
  \ the Book.\nYou can copy a spell from your own\nspellbook into another book\u2014\
  \ for example, if you want\nto make a backup copy of your spellbook.\nThis is just\
  \ like\ncopying a new spell into your spellbook, but faster and easier,\nsince you\
  \ understand your own notation and already know\nhow to cast the spell.\nYou need\
  \ spend only 1 hour and 10 gp\nfor each level of the copied spell.\nIf you lose\
  \ your spellbook, you can use the same procedure\nto transcribe the spells that\
  \ you have prepared into a new\nspellbook.\nFilling out the remainder of your spellbook\n\
  requires you to find new spells to do so, as normal.\nFor this\nreason, many wizards\
  \ keep backup spellbooks in a safe place.\nThe Book\u2019s Appearance.\nYour spellbook\
  \ is a unique\ncompilation of spells, with its own decorative flourishes and\nmargin\
  \ notes.\nIt might be a plain, functional leather volume\nthat you received as a\
  \ gift from your master, a finely bound\ngilt-edged tome you found in an ancient\
  \ library, or even a\nloose collection of notes scrounged together after you lost\n\
  your previous spellbook in a mishap.\nS p e l l b o o k\nAt 1st level, you have\
  \ a spellbook containing six 1st-level\nwizard spells of your choice.\nP r e p a\
  \ r i n g a n d C a s t i n g S p e l l s\nThe W izard table shows how many spell\
  \ slots you have\nto cast your spells of 1st level and higher.\nTo cast one of\n\
  these spells, you must expend a slot of the spell\u2019s level\nor higher.\nYou\
  \ regain all expended spell slots when you\nfinish a long rest.\nYou prepare the\
  \ list of wizard spells that are available\nfor you to cast.\nTo do so. choose a\
  \ number of wizard\nspells from your spellbook equal to your Intelligence\nmodifier\
  \ + your wizard level (minimum of one spell).\nThe\nspells must be of a level for\
  \ which you have spell slots.\nFor example, if you're a 3rd-level wizard, you have\n\
  four 1st-level and two 2nd-level spell slots.\nWith an\nIntelligence o f 16, your\
  \ list of prepared spells can\ninclude six spells of 1st or 2nd level, in any combination,\n\
  chosen from your spellbook.\nIf you prepare the 1st-level\nspell magic missile,\
  \ you can cast it using a 1st-level or a\n2nd-level slot.\nCasting the spell doesn\u2019\
  t remove it from\nyour list of prepared spells.\nYou can change your list of prepared\
  \ spells when\nyou finish a long rest.\nPreparing a new list of wizard\nspells requires\
  \ time spent studying your spellbook and\nm em orizing the incantations and gestures\
  \ you must\nmake to cast the spell: at least 1 minute per spell level\nfor each\
  \ spell on your list.\nS p e l l c a s t i n g A b i l i t y\nIntelligence is your\
  \ spellcasting ability for your wizard\nspells, since you learn your spells through\
  \ dedicated\nstudy and memorization.\nYou use your Intelligence\nwhenever a spell\
  \ refers to your spellcasting ability.\nIn addition, you use your Intelligence m\
  \ odifier when\nsetting the saving throw DC for a wizard spell you cast\nand when\
  \ making an attack roll with one.\nSpell save DC = 8 + your proficiency bonus +\n\
  your Intelligence modifier\nSpell attack modifier = your proficiency bonus +\nyour\
  \ intelligence modifier\nR i t u a l C a s t i n g\nYou can cast a wizard spell\
  \ as a ritual if that spell has\nthe ritual tag and you have the spell in your spellbook.\n\
  You don't need to have the spell prepared.\nS p e l l c a s t i n g F o c u s\n\
  You can use an arcane focus (found in chapter 5) as a\nspellcasting focus for your\
  \ wizard spells.\nL e a r n i n g S p e l l s o f 1s t L e v e l a n d H i g h e\
  \ r\nEach time you gain a w izard level, you can add two\nwizard spells of your\
  \ choice to your spellbook.\nEach\nof these spells must be of a level for which\
  \ you have\nspell slots, as shown on the W izard table.\nOn your\nadventures, you\
  \ might find other spells that you can add\nto your spellbook (see the \u201CYour\
  \ Spellbook\u201D sidebar).\nA r c a n e R e c o v e r y\nYou have learned to regain\
  \ som e of your magical energy\nby studying your spellbook.\nOnce per day when you\n\
  finish a short rest, you can choose expended spell slots\nto recover.\nThe spell\
  \ slots can have a com bined level that\nis equal to or less than half your wizard\
  \ level (rounded\nup), and none of the slots can be 6th level or higher.\nFor example,\
  \ if you\u2019re a 4th-level wizard, you can recover\nup to two levels worth of\
  \ spell slots.\nYou can recover either\na 2nd-level spell slot or two 1st-level\
  \ spell slots.\nA r c a n e T r a d i t i o n\nW hen you reach 2nd level, you choose\
  \ an arcane\ntradition, shaping your practice o f magic through one\nof eight schools:\
  \ Abjuration, Conjuration, Divination,\nEnchantment, Evocation, Illusion, Necromancy,\n\
  or Transmutation, all detailed at the end of the\nclass description.\nYour choice\

  \ i l i t y S c o r e I m p r o v e m e n t\nW hen you reach 4th level, and again\
  \ at 8th, 12th, 16th,\nand 19th level, you can increase one ability score of your\n\
  choice by 2, or you can increase two ability scores of\nyour choice by 1.\nAs normal,\
  \ you can\u2019t increase an ability\nscore above 20 using this feature.\nS p e\
  \ l l M a s t e r y\nAt 18th level, you have achieved such mastery over\ncertain\
  \ spells that you can cast them at will.\nC hoose a\n1st-level w izard spell and\
  \ a 2nd-level wizard spell that\nare in your spellbook.\nYou can cast those spells\
  \ at their\nlowest level without expending a spell slot when you\nhave them prepared.\n\
  If you want to cast either spell at a\nhigher level, you must expend a spell slot\
  \ as normal.\nBy spending 8 hours in study, you can exchange one\nor both o f the\
  \ spells you chose for different spells of\nthe sam e levels.\nS i g n a t u r e\
  \ S p e l l s\nW hen you reach 20th level, you gain mastery over two\npowerful spells\
  \ and can cast them with little effort.\nChoose two 3rd-level wizard spells in your\
  \ spellbook\nas your signature spells.\nYou always have these spells\nprepared,\
  \ they don\u2019t count against the number of spells\nyou have prepared, and you\
  \ can cast each of them once at\n3rd level without expending a spell slot.\nW hen\
  \ you do so,\nyou can\u2019t do so again until you finish a short or long rest.\n\
  If you want to cast either spell at a higher level, you\nmust expend a spell slot\
  \ as normal.\nA r c a n e T r a d it io n s\nThe study of wizardry is ancient, stretching\
  \ back to\nthe earliest mortal discoveries of magic.\nIt is firmly\nestablished\
  \ in the worlds of D&D, with various\ntraditions dedicated to its com plex study.\n\
  The most com m on arcane traditions in the multiverse\nrevolve around the schools\
  \ of magic.\nW izards through\nthe ages have cataloged thousands of spells, grouping\n\
  them into eight categories called schools, as described\nin chapter 10.\nIn som\
  \ e places, these traditions are\nliterally schools; a w izard might study at the\
  \ School of\nIllusion while another studies across town at the School\nof Enchantment.\n\
  In other institutions, the schools are\nm ore like academ ic departments, with rival\
  \ faculties\ncom peting for students and funding.\nEven w izards who\ntrain apprentices\
  \ in the solitude of their own towers use\nthe division of magic into schools as\
  \ a learning device,\nsince the spells of each school require mastery of\ndifferent\
  \ techniques.\nS c h o o l o f A b j u r a t i o n\nThe School of Abjuration em\
  \ phasizes magic that blocks,\nbanishes, or protects.\nDetractors of this school\
  \ say\nthat its tradition is about denial, negation rather than\npositive assertion.\n\
  You understand, however, that ending\nharmful effects, protecting the weak, and\
  \ banishing evil\ninfluences is anything but a philosophical void.\nIt is a\nproud\
  \ and respected vocation.\nCalled abjurers, m em bers of this school are sought\n\
  when baleful spirits require exorcism , when important\nlocations must be guarded\
  \ against magical spying, and\nwhen portals to other planes of existence must be\
  \ closed.\nA b j u r a t i o n Sa v a n t\nBeginning when you select this school\
  \ at 2nd level, the\ngold and time you must spend to copy an abjuration\nspell into\
  \ your spellbook is halved.\nA r c a n e W a r d\nStarting at 2nd level, you can\
  \ weave magic around\nyourself for protection.\nW hen you cast an abjuration\nspell\
  \ of 1st level or higher, you can simultaneously use a\nstrand of the spell\u2019\
  s magic to create a magical ward on\nyourself that lasts until you finish a long\
  \ rest.\nThe ward\nhas hit points equal to twice your wizard level + your\nIntelligence\
  \ modifier.\nW henever you take damage, the\nward takes the damage instead.\nIf\
  \ this damage reduces\nthe ward to 0 hit points, you take any remaining damage.\n\
  W hile the ward has 0 hit points, it can\u2019t absorb\ndamage, but its magic remains.\n\
  W henever you cast an\nabjuration spell of 1st level or higher, the ward regains\
  \ a\nnumber of hit points equal to twice the level of the spell.\nOnce you create\
  \ the ward, you can't create it again\nuntil you finish a long rest.\nP r o j e\
  \ c t e d W a r d\nStarting at 6th level, when a creature that you can see\nwithin\
  \ 30 feet of you takes damage, you can use your\nreaction to cause your Arcane Ward\
  \ to absorb that\ndamage.\nIf this damage reduces the ward to 0 hit points,\nthe\
  \ warded creature takes any remaining damage.\nI m p r o v e d A b j u r a t i o\
  \ n\nBeginning at 10th level, when you cast an abjuration\nspell that requires you\
  \ to make an ability check as\na part of casting that spell (as in counterspell\
  \ and\ndispel magic), you add your proficiency bonus to that\nability check.\nS\
  \ p e l l R e s i s t a n c e\nStarting at 14th level, you have advantage on saving\n\
  throws against spells.\nFurthermore, you have resistance against the\ndamage of\
  \ spells.\nS c h o o l o f C o n j u r a t i o n\nAs a conjurer, you favor spells\
  \ that produce objects\nand creatures out o f thin air.\nYou can conjure billowing\n\
  clouds of killing fog or sum m on creatures from\nelsewhere to fight on your behalf.\n\
  As your mastery\ngrows, you learn spells of transportation and can\nteleport yourself\
  \ across vast distances, even to other\nplanes of existence, in an instant.\nC o\
  \ n j u r a t i o n S a v a n t\nBeginning when you select this school at 2nd level,\
  \ the\ngold and time you must spend to copy a conjuration spell\ninto your spellbook\
  \ is halved.\nM i n o r C o n j u r a t i o n\nStarting at 2nd level when you select\
  \ this school, you\ncan use your action to conjure up an inanimate object\nin your\
  \ hand or on the ground in an unoccupied space\nthat you can see within 10 feet\
  \ of you.\nThis object can be\nno larger than 3 feet on a side and weigh no m ore\
  \ than\n10 pounds, and its form must be that of a nonm agical\nobject that you have\
  \ seen.\nThe object is visibly magical,\nradiating dim light out to 5 feet.\nThe\
  \ object disappears after 1 hour, when you use this\nfeature again, or if it takes\
  \ any damage.\nB e n i g n T r a n s p o s i t i o n\nStarting at 6th level, you\
  \ can use your action to teleport\nup to 30 feet to an unoccupied space that you\
  \ can see.\nAlternatively, you can choose a space within range\nthat is occupied\
  \ by a Small or M edium creature.\nIf that\ncreature is willing, you both teleport,\
  \ swapping places.\nOnce you use this feature, you can\u2019t use it again until\n\
  you finish a long rest or you cast a conjuration spell of\n1st level or higher.\n\
  F o c u s e d C o n j u r a t i o n\nBeginning at 10th level, while you are concentrating\
  \ on\na conjuration spell, your concentration can\u2019t be broken\nas a result\
  \ of taking damage.\nD u r a b l e S u m m o n s\nStarting at 14th level, any creature\

  \ these foretelling\nrolls.\nYou must choose to do so before the roll, and you\n\
  can replace a roll in this way only once per turn.\nEach foretelling roll can be\

  The charm ed creature\u2019s\nspeed drops to 0, and the creature is incapacitated\

  \ you can see, you can choose a number\nof them equal to 1 + the spell\u2019s level.\n\
  The chosen\ncreatures automatically succeed on their saving throws\nagainst the\

  \ on magic that dazzles the\nsenses, befuddles the mind, and tricks even the wisest\n\
  folk.\nYour magic is subtle, but the illusions crafted by\nyour keen mind make the\

  The cantrip doesn\u2019t count against your number\nof cantrips known.\nW hen you\
  \ cast minor illusion, you can create both a\nsound and an image with a single casting\
  \ o f the spell.\nM a l l e a b l e I l l u s i o n s\nStarting at 6th level, when\

  I l l u s o r y S e l f\nBeginning at 10th level, you can create an illusory\nduplicate\

  \ illusory duplicate between the attacker and\nyourself.\nThe attack automatically\

  t use it again until\nyou finish a short or long rest.\nI l l u s o r y R e a l\
  \ i t y\nBy 14th level, you have learned the secret of weaving\nshadow magic into\
  \ your illusions to give them a sem i-\nreality.\nW hen you cast an illusion spell\
  \ of 1st level or\nhigher, you can choose one inanimate, nonm agical\nobject that\
  \ is part of the illusion and make that object\nreal.\nYou can do this on your turn\
  \ as a bonus action\nwhile the spell is ongoing.\nThe object remains real for\n\
  1 minute.\nFor example, you can create an illusion of a\nbridge over a chasm and\
  \ then make it real long enough\nfor your allies to cross.\nThe object can\u2019\

  sap the life force from a creature as your magic destroys\nits body, transforming\
  \ that vital energy into magical\npower you can manipulate.\nMost people see necrom\
  \ ancers as menacing, or even\nvillainous, due to the close association with death.\n\
  Not all necrom ancers are evil, but the forces they\nmanipulate are considered taboo\
  \ by many societies.\nN e c r o m a n c y S a v a n t\nBeginning when you select\

  or pile of bones, creating another zom bie or skeleton,\nas appropriate.\nW henever\
  \ you create an undead using a necrom ancy\nspell, it has additional benefits:\n\
  \u2022 The creature\u2019s hit point maximum is increased by an\namount equal to\

  \ U n d e a d\nStarting at 14th level, you can use m agic to bring\nundead under\

  For each 10 minutes\nyou spend perform ing the procedure, you can transform\nup\

  \ from one another,\nincluding the basics of name and physical description,\nthe\
  \ rules of backgrounds and languages, and the finer\npoints of personality and alignment.\n\
  C h a r a c t e r D e t a il s\nYour character\u2019s name and physical description\
  \ might\nbe the first things that the other players at the table\nlearn about you.\n\
  It\u2019s worth thinking about how these\ncharacteristics reflect the character\
  \ you have in mind.\nN a m e\nYour character\u2019s race description includes sample\n\
  names for m em bers o f that race.\nPut som e thought into\nyour name even if you\u2019\
  re just picking one from a list.\nS e x\nYou can play a male or female character\
  \ without gaining\nany special benefits or hindrances.\nThink about how\nyour character\
  \ does or does not conform to the broader\nculture\u2019s expectations of sex, gender,\
  \ and sexual\nbehavior.\nFor example, a male drow cleric defies the\ntraditional\
  \ gender divisions of drow society, which could\nbe a reason for your character\
  \ to leave that society and\ncom e to the surface.\nT i k a a n d A r t e m i s\
  \ : C o n t r a s t i n g C h a r a c t e r s\nThe details in this chapter make\
  \ a big difference in setting\nyour character apart from every other character.\n\
  Consider the\nfollowing two human fighters.\nHailing from the Dragonlance setting,\
  \ Tika Waylan was a\nbrash teenager who had a rough childhood.\nThe daughter of\n\
  a thief, she ran away from home and practiced her father\u2019s\ntrade on the streets\
  \ of Solace.\nWhen she tried to rob the\nproprietor of the Inn of the Last Home,\
  \ he caught her and\ntook her under his wing, giving her a job as a barmaid.\nBut\n\
  when the dragonarmies laid waste to the town of Solace\nand destroyed the inn, necessity\
  \ forced Tika into adventure\nalongside the friends she\u2019d known from her childhood.\n\
  Her\nskill as a fighter (a frying pan remains one of her favorite\nweapons) combined\
  \ with her history on the streets gave her\nskills invaluable in her adventuring\
  \ career.\nArtemis Entreri grew up on the streets of Calimport in the\nForgotten\
  \ Realms.\nHe used his wits, strength, and agility\nto carve out his own territory\
  \ in one of the city's hundreds\nof poor shanty towns.\nAfter several years, he\
  \ attracted the\nnotice of one of the most powerful thieves\u2019 guilds in the\
  \ city,\nand he ascended the ranks of the guild quickly despite his\nyouth.\nArtemis\
  \ became the favored assassin of one of the\ncity\u2019s pashas, who sent him to\
  \ far-off Icewind Dale to recover\nsome stolen gems.\nHe\u2019s a professional killer,\
  \ constantly\nchallenging himself to improve his skills.\nTika and Artemis are both\
  \ human and both fighters (with\nsome experience as rogues), possessing similarly\
  \ high\nStrength and Dexterity scores, but there the similarity ends.\nYou don\u2019\
  t need to be confined to binary notions of\nsex and gender.\nThe elf god Corellon\
  \ Larethian is often\nseen as androgynous or hermaphroditic, for example,\nand som\
  \ e elves in the multiverse are made in Corellon\u2019s\nimage.\nYou could also\
  \ play a female character who\npresents herself as a man, a man w ho feels trapped\
  \ in a\nfemale body, or a bearded female dwarf who hates being\nmistaken for a male.\n\
  Likewise, your character\u2019s sexual\norientation is for you to decide.\nH e i\
  \ g h t a n d W e i g h t\nYou can decide your character\u2019s height and weight,\n\
  using the information provided in your race description\nor on the Random Height\
  \ and Weight table.\nThink about\nwhat your character\u2019s ability scores might\
  \ say about his\nor her height and weight.\nA weak but agile character\nmight be\
  \ thin.\nA strong and tough character might be\ntall or just heavy.\nIf you want\
  \ to, you can roll randomly for your\ncharacter\u2019s height and weight using the\
  \ Random Height\nand W eight table.\nThe dice roll given in the Height\nModifier\
  \ colum n determines the character\u2019s extra\nheight (in inches) beyond the base\
  \ height.\nThat same\nnum ber multiplied by the dice roll or quantity given in\n\
  the Weight Modifier colum n determines the character\u2019s\nextra weight (in pounds)\
  \ beyond the base weight.\nR a n d o m H e i g h t a n d W e i g h t\nBase\nHeight\n\

  \ 4 feet 8\ninches plus 2d10 inches.\nHer player rolls 2 d 10 and gets\na total\
  \ of 12, so Tika stands 5 feet 8 inches tall.\nThen\nthe player uses that sam e\
  \ roll of 12 and multiplies it by\n2d4 pounds.\nHer 2d4 roll is 3, so Tika weighs\
  \ an extra\n36 pounds ( 1 2 x 3) on top of her base 110 pounds, for a\ntotal of\
  \ 146 pounds.\nO t h e r P h y s i c a l C h a r a c t e r i s t i c s\nYou choose\
  \ your character\u2019s age and the color of\nhis or her hair, eyes, and skin.\n\
  To add a touch of\ndistinctiveness, you might want to give your character\nan unusual\
  \ or memorable physical characteristic, such\nas a scar, a limp, or a tattoo.\n\
  T i k a a n d A r t e m i s : C h a r a c t e r D e t a i l s\nConsider how the\
  \ names Tika Waylan and Artemis Entreri\nset these characters apart from each other\
  \ and reflect their\npersonalities.\nTika is a young woman determined to prove\n\
  that she's not just a kid any more, and her name makes her\nsound young and ordinary.\n\
  Artemis Entreri comes from an\nexotic land and carries a more mysterious name.\n\
  Tika is nineteen years old at the start of her adventuring\ncareer and has auburn\
  \ hair, green eyes, fair skin with freckles,\nand a mole on her right hip.\nArtemis\
  \ is a small man, compact\nand all wiry muscle.\nHe has angular features and high\n\
  cheekbones, and he always seems in need of a shave.\nHis\nraven-black hair is thick\
  \ and full, but his eyes are gray and\nlifeless\u2014 betraying the emptiness of\
  \ his life and soul.\nA l i g n m e n t\nA typical creature in the worlds of D u\
  \ n g e o n s &\nD r a g o n s has an alignment, which broadly describes\nits moral\
  \ and personal attitudes.\nAlignment is a\ncombination of two factors: one identifies\
  \ morality\n(good, evil, or neutral), and the other describes\nattitudes toward\
  \ society and order (lawful, chaotic,\nor neutral).\nThus, nine distinct alignments\
  \ define the\npossible combinations.\nThese brief sum m aries of the nine alignments\n\
  describe the typical behavior of a creature with that\nalignment.\nIndividuals might\
  \ vary significantly from\nthat typical behavior, and few people are perfectly and\n\
  consistently faithful to the precepts of their alignment.\nLawful good (LG) creatures\
  \ can be counted on to do\nthe right thing as expected by society.\nGold dragons,\n\
  paladins, and m ost dwarves are lawful good.\nNeutral good (NG) folk do the best\
  \ they can to help\nothers according to their needs.\nMany celestials, som e\ncloud\
  \ giants, and most gnom es are neutral good.\nChaotic good (CG) creatures act as\
  \ their conscience\ndirects, with little regard for what others expect.\nCopper\n\
  dragons, many elves, and unicorns are chaotic good.\nLawful neutral (LN) individuals\
  \ act in accordance\nwith law, tradition, or personal codes.\nMany m onks and\n\

  A l i g n m e n t i n t h e M u l t i v e r s e\nFor many thinking creatures, alignment\
  \ is a moral\nchoice.\nHumans, dwarves, elves, and other humanoid\nraces can choose\
  \ whether to follow the paths of good or\nevil, law or chaos.\nAccording to myth,\
  \ the good-aligned\ngods w ho created these races gave them free will to\nchoose\
  \ their moral paths, knowing that good without\nfree will is slavery.\nThe evil\
  \ deities w ho created other races, though, made\nthose races to serve them.\nThose\
  \ races have strong\ninborn tendencies that match the nature of their gods.\nMost\
  \ orcs share the violent, savage nature of the orc\ngod, Gruumsh, and are thus inclined\
  \ toward evil.\nEven if\nan orc chooses a good alignment, it struggles against its\n\
  innate tendencies for its entire life. (Even half-orcs feel\nthe lingering pull\
  \ of the orc god\u2019s influence.)\nAlignment is an essential part of the nature\
  \ of\ncelestials and fiends.\nA devil does not choose to be\nlawful evil, and it\
  \ doesn\u2019t tend toward lawful evil, but\nrather it is lawful evil in its essence.\n\
  If it som ehow\nceased to be lawful evil, it w ould cease to be a devil.\nMost creatures\
  \ that lack the capacity for rational\nthought do not have alignments\u2014they\
  \ are unaligned.\nSuch a creature is incapable of making a moral or\nethical choice\
  \ and acts according to its bestial nature.\nSharks are savage predators, for example,\
  \ but they are\nnot evil; they have no alignment.\nL a n g u a g e s\nYour race\
  \ indicates the languages your character can\nspeak by default, and your background\
  \ might give you\naccess to one or m ore additional languages o f your\nchoice.\n\

  \ table or a secret\nlanguage, such as thieves\u2019 cant or the tongue of druids.\n\
  Som e of these languages are actually families\nof languages with many dialects.\n\
  For example, the\nPrimordial language includes the Auran, Aquan, Ignan,\nand Terran\

  \ m e n t\nTika Waylan is neutral good, fundamentally good-hearted\nand striving\
  \ to help others where she can.\nArtemis is lawful\nevil, unconcerned with the value\
  \ of sentient life but at least\nprofessional in his approach to murder.\nAs an\
  \ evil character, Artemis is not an ideal adventurer.\nHe\nbegan his career as a\
  \ villain, and only cooperates with heroes\nwhen he must\u2014 and when it\u2019\
  s in his own best interests.\nIn\nmost games, evil adventurers cause problems in\
  \ groups\nalongside others who don\u2019t share their interests and objectives.\n\
  Generally, evil alignments are for villains and monsters.\nP e r s o n a l C h a\
  \ r a c t e r i s t i c s\nFleshing out your character\u2019s personality\u2014\
  the array of\ntraits, mannerisms, habits, beliefs, and flaws that give\na person\
  \ a unique identity\u2014will help you bring him\nor her to life as you play the\
  \ game.\nFour categories of\ncharacteristics are presented here: personality traits,\n\
  ideals, bonds, and flaws.\nBeyond those categories,\nthink about your character\u2019\
  s favorite w ords or phrases,\ntics and habitual gestures, vices and pet peeves,\
  \ and\nwhatever else you can imagine.\nEach background presented later in this chapter\n\
  includes suggested characteristics that you can use\nto spark your imagination.\n\
  You\u2019re not bound to those\noptions, but they\u2019re a good starting point.\n\
  P e r s o n a l i t y T r a i t s\nGive your character two personality traits.\n\
  Personality\ntraits are small, simple ways to help you set your\ncharacter apart\
  \ from every other character.\nYour\npersonality traits should tell you som ething\
  \ interesting\nand fun about your character.\nThey should be self-\ndescriptions\
  \ that are specific about what makes your\ncharacter stand out. \u201CI\u2019m sm\
  \ art\u201D is not a good trait,\nbecause it describes a lot of characters. \u201C\
  I\u2019ve read every\nbook in Candlekeep\u201D tells you som ething specific about\n\
  your character\u2019s interests and disposition.\nPersonality traits might describe\
  \ the things your\ncharacter likes, his or her past accomplishments, things\nyour\
  \ character dislikes or fears, your character\u2019s self-\nattitude or mannerisms,\
  \ or the influence o f his or her\nability scores.\nE l v i s h S c r i p t : S\

  \ r a c t e r i s t i c s\nTika and Artemis have distinct personality traits.\n\
  Tika Waylan\ndislikes boastfulness and has a fear of heights resulting\nfrom a bad\
  \ fall during her career as a thief.\nArtemis Entreri\nis always prepared for the\
  \ worst and moves with a quick,\nprecise confidence.\nConsider their ideals.\nTika\
  \ Waylan is innocent, almost\nchildlike, believing in the value of life and the\
  \ importance of\nappreciating everyone.\nNeutral good in alignment, she cleaves\n\
  to ideals of life and respect.\nArtemis Entreri never allows\nhis emotions to master\
  \ him, and he constantly challenges\nhimself to improve his skills.\nHis lawful\
  \ evil alignment gives\nhim ideals of impartiality and a lust for power.\nTika Waylan\u2019\
  s bond is to the Inn of the Last Home.\nThe\ninn\u2019s proprietor gave her a new\
  \ chance at life, and her\nfriendship with her adventuring companions was forged\n\
  during her time working there.\nIts destruction by the\nmarauding dragonarmies gives\
  \ Tika a very personal reason to\nhate them with a fiery passion.\nHer bond might\
  \ be phrased\nas \u201C I will do whatever it takes to punish the dragonarmies for\n\
  the destruction of the Inn of the Last Home.\u201D\nArtemis Entreri\u2019s bond\
  \ is a strange, almost paradoxical\nrelationship with Drizzt Do\u2019Urden, his\
  \ equal in swordplay\nand grim determination.\nIn his first battle with Drizzt,\n\
  Artemis recognized something of himself in his opponent,\nsome indication that if\
  \ his life had gone differently, he\nmight have led a life more like the heroic\
  \ drow\u2019s.\nFrom that\nmoment, Artemis is more than a criminal assassin\u2014\
  \ he is an\nantihero, driven by his rivalry with Drizzt.\nHis bond might be\nphrased\
  \ as \u201C I will not rest until I have proved myself better\nthan Drizzt Do\u2019\
  Urden.\u201D\nEach of these characters also has an important flaw.\nTika Waylan\
  \ is naive and emotionally vulnerable, younger\nthan her companions and annoyed\
  \ that they still think\nof her as the kid they knew years ago.\nShe might even\
  \ be\ntempted to act against her principles if she's convinced that\na particular\
  \ achievement would demonstrate her maturity.\nArtemis Entreri is completely walled\
  \ off from any personal\nrelationship and just wants to be left alone.\nA useful\
  \ place to start thinking about personality\ntraits is to look at your highest and\
  \ lowest ability scores\nand define one trait related to each.\nEither one could\
  \ be\npositive or negative: you might work hard to overcome a\nlow score, for example,\
  \ or be cocky about your high score.\nD r a c o n i c S c r i p t : S a m p l e\
  \ A l p h a b e t\nI d e a l s\nDescribe one ideal that drives your character.\n\
  Your ideals\nare the things that you believe in m ost strongly, the\nfundamental\
  \ moral and ethical principles that com pel you\nto act as you do.\nIdeals encom\
  \ pass everything from your\nlife goals to your core belief system.\nIdeals might\
  \ answer any of these questions: What are\nthe principles that you will never betray?\n\
  What would\nprompt you to make sacrifices?\nWhat drives you to act\nand guides your\
  \ goals and ambitions?\nW hat is the single\nmost important thing you strive for?\n\
  You can choose any ideals you like, but your\ncharacter\u2019s alignment is a good\
  \ place to start defining\nthem.\nEach background in this chapter includes six\n\
  suggested ideals.\nFive of them are linked to aspects of\nalignment: law, chaos,\
  \ good, evil, and neutrality.\nThe last\none has m ore to do with the particular\
  \ background than\nwith moral or ethical perspectives.\nB o n d s\nCreate one bond\
  \ for your character.\nBonds represent a\ncharacter\u2019s connections to people,\
  \ places, and events in\nthe world.\nThey tie you to things from your background.\n\
  They might inspire you to heights of heroism, or lead\nyou to act against your own\
  \ best interests if they are\nthreatened.\nThey can w ork very much like ideals,\n\
  driving a character\u2019s motivations and goals.\nBonds might answer any of these\
  \ questions: W hom do\nyou care m ost about?\nTo what place do you feel a special\n\
  connection?\nWhat is your most treasured possession?\nYour bonds might be tied to\
  \ your class, your\nbackground, your race, or som e other aspect of your\ncharacter\u2019\
  s history or personality.\nYou might also gain\nnew bonds over the course of your\
  \ adventures.\nF l a w s\nFinally, choose a flaw for your character.\nYour\ncharacter\u2019\
  s flaw represents som e vice, compulsion, fear,\nor w eakness\u2014in particular,\
  \ anything that som eone\nelse could exploit to bring you to ruin or cause you to\n\
  act against your best interests.\nMore significant than\nnegative personality traits,\
  \ a flaw might answer any\nof these questions: What enrages you?\nW hat\u2019s the\
  \ one\nperson, concept, or event that you are terrified of?\nWhat\nare your vices?\n\
  In s p ir a t io n\nInspiration is a rule the Dungeon Master can use to\nreward\
  \ you for playing your character in a way that\u2019s\ntrue to his or her personality\
  \ traits, ideal, bond, and flaw.\nBy using inspiration, you can draw on your personality\n\
  trait of com passion for the downtrodden to give you\nan edge in negotiating with\
  \ the Beggar Prince.\nOr\ninspiration can let you call on your bond to the defense\n\
  of your home village to push past the effect of a spell\nthat has been laid on you.\n\
  G a i n i n g I n s p i r a t i o n\nYour DM can choose to give you inspiration\
  \ for a variety\nof reasons.\nTypically, DMs award it when you play\nout your personality\
  \ traits, give in to the drawbacks\npresented by a flaw or bond, and otherwise portray\
  \ your\ncharacter in a com pelling way.\nYour DM will tell you\nhow you can earn\
  \ inspiration in the game.\nYou either have inspiration or you don\u2019t\u2014\
  you can\u2019t\nstockpile multiple \u201Cinspirations\u201D for later use.\nU s\
  \ i n g I n s p i r a t i o n\nIf you have inspiration, you can expend it when you\
  \ make\nan attack roll, saving throw, or ability check.\nSpending\nyour inspiration\
  \ gives you advantage on that roll.\nAdditionally, if you have inspiration, you\
  \ can reward\nanother player for good roleplaying, clever thinking,\nor simply doing\
  \ som ething exciting in the game.\nW hen another player character does som ething\
  \ that\nreally contributes to the story in a fun and interesting\nway, you can give\
  \ up your inspiration to give that\ncharacter inspiration.\nBa c k g r o u n d s\n\
  Every story has a beginning.\nYour character\u2019s\nbackground reveals w here you\
  \ cam e from, how you\nbecam e an adventurer, and your place in the world.\nYour\
  \ fighter might have been a courageous knight or a\ngrizzled soldier.\nYour wizard\
  \ could have been a sage or\nan artisan.\nYour rogue might have gotten by as a guild\n\
  thief or com m anded audiences as a jester.\nChoosing a background provides you\
  \ with important\nstory cues about your character\u2019s identity.\nThe most\nimportant\
  \ question to ask about your background is\nwhat changed?\nW hy did you stop doing\
  \ whatever your\nbackground describes and start adventuring?\nW here\ndid you get\
  \ the m oney to purchase your starting gear, or,\nif you com e from a wealthy background,\
  \ why don't you\nhave more money?\nH ow did you learn the skills of your\nclass?\n\
  W hat sets you apart from ordinary people who\nshare your background?\nT i k a a\

  \ lived their earliest years\nas street urchins.\nTika\u2019s later career as a\
  \ barmaid didn\u2019t really\nchange her, so she might choose the urchin background,\n\
  gaining proficiency in the Sleight of Hand and Stealth skills,\nand learning the\
  \ tools of the thieving trade.\nArtemis is more\ndefined by his criminal background,\
  \ giving him skills in\nDeception and Stealth, as well as proficiency with the tools\
  \ of\nthievery and poison.\nThe sample backgrounds in this chapter provide\nboth\

  \ are detailed in chapter 5.\nIf a character would gain the same proficiency from\n\
  two different sources, he or she can choose a different\nproficiency of the same\

  \ nobility trade either in legal rights, such\nas the rights to a mine, a port,\

  coin.\nOnly merchants, adventurers, and those offering\nprofessional services for\
  \ hire com m only deal in coins.\nC o i n a g e\nCom m on coins com e in several\
  \ different denominations\nbased on the relative worth of the metal from which they\n\
  are made.\nThe three most com m on coins are the gold\npiece (gp), the silver piece\
  \ (sp), and the copper piece (cp).\nWith one gold piece, a character can buy a belt\n\
  pouch, 50 feet of good rope, or a goat.\nA skilled (but\nnot exceptional) artisan\
  \ can earn one gold piece a day.\nThe gold piece is the standard unit of measure\
  \ for\nwealth, even if the coin itself is not com m only used.\nW hen merchants\
  \ discuss deals that involve goods or\nservices worth hundreds or thousands of gold\
  \ pieces,\nthe transactions don\u2019t usually involve the exchange of\nindividual\
  \ coins.\nRather, the gold piece is a standard\nm easure of value, and the actual\
  \ exchange is in gold\nbars, letters of credit, or valuable goods.\nOne gold piece\
  \ is w orth ten silver pieces, the most\nprevalent coin among com m oners.\nA silver\
  \ piece buys a\nlaborer\u2019s w ork for a day, a flask of lamp oil, or a night\u2019\
  s\nrest in a poor inn.\nOne silver piece is worth ten copper pieces, which are\n\
  com m on am ong laborers and beggars.\nA single copper\npiece buys a candle, a torch,\
  \ or a piece of chalk.\nIn addition, unusual coins made of other precious\nmetals\
  \ som etim es appear in treasure hoards.\nThe\nelectrum piece (ep) and the platinum\
  \ piece (pp) originate\nfrom fallen empires and lost kingdom s, and they\nsom etim\
  \ es arouse suspicion and skepticism when used\nin transactions.\nAn electrum piece\
  \ is worth five silver\npieces, and a platinum piece is worth ten gold pieces.\n\
  A standard coin weighs about a third of an ounce,\nso fifty coins weigh a pound.\n\

  \ halfling\nfarmers and gnome jewelers, not to mention\nhumans of every shape, size,\
  \ and color\ndrawn from a spectrum of nations and\ncultures.\nIn the largest cities,\
  \ almost\nanything imaginable is offered for sale, from exotic\nspices and luxurious\
  \ clothing to wicker baskets and\npractical swords.\nFor an adventurer, the availability\
  \ of armor, weapons,\nbackpacks, rope, and similar goods is of paramount\nim portance,\
  \ since proper equipment can mean the\ndifference between life and death in a dungeon\
  \ or the\nuntamed wilds.\nThis chapter details the mundane and\nexotic merchandise\
  \ that adventurers commonly find useful\nin the face of the threats that the worlds\
  \ of D&D present.\nSt a r t in g E q u ip m e n t\nW hen you create your character,\
  \ you receive equipment\nbased on a combination of your class and background.\n\
  Alternatively, you can start with a num ber of gold pieces\nbased on your class\
  \ and spend them on items from the\nlists in this chapter.\nSee the Starting Wealth\
  \ by Class\ntable to determine how much gold you have to spend.\nYou decide how\
  \ your character cam e by this starting\nequipment.\nIt might have been an inheritance,\
  \ or goods\nthat the character purchased during his or her upbringing.\nYou might\
  \ have been equipped with a weapon, armor, and\na backpack as part of military service.\n\
  You might even have\nstolen your gear.\nA w eapon could be a family heirloom,\n\
  passed down from generation to generation until your\ncharacter finally took up\
  \ the mantle and followed in an\nancestor\u2019s adventurous footsteps.\nW e a l\
  \ t h\nWealth appears in many forms in a D&D world.\nCoins,\ngemstones, trade goods,\
  \ art objects, animals, and\nproperty can reflect your character\u2019s financial\
  \ well-being.\nMembers of the peasantry trade in goods, bartering for\nwhat they\

  \ to find treasure, equipment,\nweapons, armor, and m ore in the dungeons you explore.\n\
  Normally, you can sell your treasures and trinkets when\nyou return to a town or\
  \ other settlement, provided that you\ncan find buyers and merchants interested\
  \ in your loot.\nArms, Armor, and Other Equipment.\nAs a general\nrule, undamaged\
  \ weapons, armor, and other equipment\nfetch half their cost when sold in a market.\n\
  W eapons\nand armor used by m onsters are rarely in good enough\ncondition to sell.\n\
  Magic Items.\nSelling m agic items is problematic.\nFinding som eone to buy a potion\
  \ or a scroll isn\u2019t too\nhard, but other items are out of the realm of most\
  \ but the\nwealthiest nobles.\nLikewise, aside from a few com m on\nmagic items,\
  \ you w on\u2019t normally com e across magic\nitems or spells to purchase.\nThe\
  \ value of magic is far\nbeyond simple gold and should always be treated as such.\n\
  Gems, Jewelry, and Art Objects.\nThese items retain\ntheir full value in the marketplace,\
  \ and you can either\ntrade them in for coin or use them as currency for other\n\
  transactions.\nFor exceptionally valuable treasures, the\nDM might require you to\
  \ find a buyer in a large town or\nlarger community first.\nTrade Goods.\nOn the\
  \ borderlands, many people\nconduct transactions through barter.\nLike gems and\
  \ art\nobjects, trade goods\u2014bars of iron, bags of salt, livestock,\nand so\
  \ on\u2014retain their full value in the market and can\nbe used as currency.\n\
  A r m o r a n d Sh ie l d s\nD&D worlds are a vast tapestry made up of many\ndifferent\
  \ cultures, each with its own technology level.\nFor this reason, adventurers have\
  \ access to a variety\nof armor types, ranging from leather armor to chain\nmail\
  \ to costly plate armor, with several other kinds of\narmor in between.\nThe Arm\
  \ or table collects the most\ncom m only available types of armor found in the game\n\
  and separates them into three categories: light armor,\nmedium armor, and heavy\
  \ armor.\nMany warriors\nsupplement their armor with a shield.\nV a r i a n t :\
  \ E q u i p m e n t S i z e s\nIn most campaigns, you can use or wear any equipment\
  \ that\nyou find on your adventures, within the bounds of common\nsense.\nFor example,\
  \ a burly half-orc won't fit in a halfling\u2019s\nleather armor, and a gnome would\
  \ be swallowed up in a\ncloud giant\u2019s elegant robe.\nThe DM can impose more\
  \ realism.\nFor example, a suit of\nplate armor made for one human might not fit\
  \ another one\nwithout significant alterations, and a guard\u2019s uniform might\n\
  be visibly ill-fitting when an adventurer tries to wear it as a\ndisguise.\nUsing\
  \ this variant, when adventurers find armor, clothing,\nand similar items that are\
  \ made to be worn, they might need\nto visit an armorsmith, tailor, leatherworker,\
  \ or similar expert\nto make the item wearable.\nThe cost for such work varies\n\
  from 10 to 40 percent of the market price of the item.\nThe\nDM can either roll\
  \ 1d4 x 10 or determine the increase in cost\nbased on the extent of the alterations\
  \ required.\nThe Arm or table shows the cost, weight, and other\nproperties of the\
  \ com m on types of armor worn in the\nworlds of D&D.\nArmor Proficiency.\nAnyone\
  \ can put on a suit o f armor\nor strap a shield to an arm.\nOnly those proficient\
  \ in the\narm or\u2019s use know how to w ear it effectively, however.\nYour class\
  \ gives you proficiency with certain types of\narmor.\nIf you w ear armor that you\
  \ lack proficiency with,\nyou have disadvantage on any ability check, saving\nthrow,\
  \ or attack roll that involves Strength or Dexterity,\nand you can\u2019t cast spells.\n\
  Armor Class (AC).\nArm or protects its w earer from\nattacks.\nThe armor (and shield)\
  \ you w ear determines\nyour base Arm or Class.\nHeavy Armor.\nHeavier armor interferes\
  \ with the\nw earer\u2019s ability to move quickly, stealthily, and freely.\nIf\
  \ the Arm or table shows \u201CStr 13\u201D or \u201CStr 15\u201D in the\nStrength\
  \ colum n for an armor type, the armor reduces\nthe w earer\u2019s speed by 10 feet\
  \ unless the w earer has a\nStrength score equal to or higher than the listed score.\n\
  Stealth.\nIf the Arm or table shows \u201CDisadvantage\u201D in\nthe Stealth column,\
  \ the wearer has disadvantage on\nDexterity (Stealth) checks.\nShields.\nA shield\
  \ is made from w ood or metal and\nis carried in one hand.\nW ielding a shield increases\n\
  your Arm or Class by 2.\nYou can benefit from only one\nshield at a time.\nL i g\
  \ h t A r m o r\nMade from supple and thin materials, light arm or favors\nagile\
  \ adventurers since it offers som e protection without\nsacrificing mobility.\n\
  If you w ear light armor, you add\nyour Dexterity m odifier to the base number from\
  \ your\narmor type to determine your Arm or Class.\nPadded.\nPadded armor consists\
  \ of quilted layers of\ncloth and batting.\nLeather.\nThe breastplate and shoulder\
  \ protectors of\nthis arm or are made of leather that has been stiffened\nby being\
  \ boiled in oil.\nThe rest of the armor is made of\nsofter and m ore flexible materials.\n\
  Studded Leather.\nMade from tough but flexible\nleather, studded leather is reinforced\
  \ with close-set\nrivets or spikes.\nM e d i u m A r m o r\nMedium armor offers\
  \ m ore protection than light armor,\nbut it also impairs movement more.\nIf you\
  \ wear medium\narmor, you add your Dexterity modifier, to a maximum\nof +2, to the\
  \ base number from your armor type to\ndetermine your Arm or Class.\nHide.\nThis\
  \ crude arm or consists o f thick furs and\npelts.\nIt is com m only worn by barbarian\
  \ tribes, evil\nhumanoids, and other folk who lack access to the tools\nand materials\
  \ needed to create better armor.\nChain Shirt.\nMade of interlocking metal rings,\
  \ a chain\nshirt is worn between layers o f clothing or leather.\nThis\narmor offers\

  M ost warriors use martial\nw eapons because these w eapons put their fighting style\n\
  and training to best use.\nProficiency with a w eapon allows you to add your\nproficiency\
  \ bonus to the attack roll for any attack you\nmake with that weapon.\nIf you make\
  \ an attack roll using\na w eapon with w hich you lack proficiency, you do not\n\
  add your proficiency bonus to the attack roll.\nW e a p o n P r o p e r t i e s\n\
  Many weapons have special properties related to their use,\nas shown in the W eapons\
  \ table.\nAmmunition.\nYou can use a weapon that has the\nammunition property to\
  \ make a ranged attack only if\nyou have ammunition to fire from the weapon.\nEach\n\
  time you attack with the weapon, you expend one piece\nof ammunition.\nDrawing the\
  \ ammunition from a quiver,\ncase, or other container is part of the attack.\nAt\
  \ the\nend of the battle, you can recover half your expended\nammunition by taking\
  \ a minute to search the battlefield.\nYour class grants proficiency in certain\
  \ weapons,\nreflecting both the class's focus and the tools you are\nmost likely\
  \ to use.\nW hether you favor a longsword or\na longbow, your w eapon and your ability\
  \ to wield it\neffectively can m ean the difference between life and\ndeath while\
  \ adventuring.\nThe W eapons table shows the most com m on weapons\nused in the\
  \ worlds of D&D, their price and weight,\nthe damage they deal when they hit, and\
  \ any special\nproperties they possess.\nEvery weapon is classified\nas either melee\
  \ or ranged.\nA melee weapon is used to\nattack a target within 5 feet of you, whereas\
  \ a ranged\nweapon is used to attack a target at a distance.\nIf you use a weapon\
  \ that has the ammunition property\nto make a melee attack, you treat the weapon\
  \ as an\nimprovised weapon (see \"Improvised Weapons\" later in\nthe section).\n\
  A sling must be loaded to deal any damage\nwhen used in this way.\nFinesse.\nWhen\
  \ making an attack with a finesse\nweapon, you use your choice o f your Strength\
  \ or\nDexterity modifier for the attack and damage rolls.\nYou\nmust use the same\
  \ m odifier for both rolls.\nHeavy.\nSm all creatures have disadvantage on attack\n\
  rolls with heavy weapons.\nA heavy w eapon\u2019s size and\nbulk make it too large\
  \ for a Sm all creature to use\neffectively.\nLight.\nA light weapon is small and\
  \ easy to handle,\nmaking it ideal for use when fighting with two weapons.\nSee\
  \ the rules for two-weapon fighting in chapter 9.\nLoading.\nBecause of the time\
  \ required to load this\nweapon, you can fire only one piece of ammunition\nfrom\
  \ it when you use an action, bonus action, or reaction\nto fire it, regardless of\
  \ the number of attacks you can\nnormally make.\nRange.\nA weapon that can be used\
  \ to make a ranged\nattack has a range shown in parentheses after the\nammunition\
  \ or thrown property.\nThe range lists two\nnumbers.\nThe first is the w eapon\u2019\
  s normal range in feet,\nand the second indicates the w eapon\u2019s maximum range.\n\
  W hen attacking a target beyond normal range, you have\ndisadvantage on the attack\
  \ roll.\nYou can\u2019t attack a target\nbeyond the w eapon\u2019s long range.\n\
  Reach.\nThis w eapon adds 5 feet to your reach when\nyou attack with it.\nSpecial.\n\
  A w eapon with the special property has\nunusual rules governing its use, explained\
  \ in the\nw eapon\u2019s description (see \"Special W eapons\" later in\nthis section).\n\
  Thrown.\nIf a weapon has the thrown property, you\ncan throw the w eapon to make\
  \ a ranged attack.\nIf the\nweapon is a melee weapon, you use the same ability\n\
  m odifier for that attack roll and damage roll that you\nwould use for a melee attack\
  \ with the weapon.\nFor\nexample, if you throw a handaxe, you use your Strength,\n\
  but if you throw a dagger, you can use either your\nStrength or your Dexterity,\
  \ since the dagger has the\nfinesse property.\nTwo-Handed.\nThis w eapon requires\
  \ two hands to use.\nVersatile.\nThis weapon can be used with one or two\nhands.\n\
  A damage value in parentheses appears with the\nproperty\u2014the damage when the\
  \ weapon is used with\ntwo hands to make a melee attack.\nI m p r o v i s e d W\
  \ e a p o n s\nSom etim es characters don\u2019t have their w eapons and\nhave to\
  \ attack with whatever is close at hand.\nAn\nim provised weapon includes any object\
  \ you can wield\nin one or two hands, such as broken glass, a table leg, a\nfrying\
  \ pan, a w agon wheel, or a dead goblin.\nIn many cases, an im provised weapon is\
  \ similar\nto an actual weapon and can be treated as such.\nFor\nexample, a table\
  \ leg is akin to a club.\nAt the DM \u2019s option,\na character proficient with\
  \ a weapon can use a similar\nobject as if it w ere that weapon and use his or her\n\
  proficiency bonus.\nAn object that bears no resem blance to a weapon\ndeals 1d4\
  \ damage (the DM assigns a damage type\nappropriate to the object).\nIf a character\
  \ uses a ranged\nweapon to make a m elee attack, or throws a melee\nweapon that\
  \ does not have the thrown property, it also\ndeals 1d4 damage.\nAn improvised thrown\
  \ weapon has a\nnormal range of 20 feet and a long range of 60 feet.\nS i l v e\
  \ r e d W e a p o n s\nSom e m onsters that have immunity or resistance\nto nonm\
  \ agical w eapons are susceptible to silver\nweapons, so cautious adventurers invest\
  \ extra coin to\nplate their w eapons with silver.\nYou can silver a single\nweapon\
  \ or ten pieces of ammunition for 100 gp.\nThis\ncost represents not only the price\
  \ of the silver, but the\ntime and expertise needed to add silver to the weapon\n\
  without making it less effective.\nS p e c i a l W e a p o n s\nW eapons with special\
  \ rules are described here.\nLance.\nYou have disadvantage when you use a lance\n\
  to attack a target within 5 feet of you.\nAlso, a lance\nrequires two hands to wield\
  \ when you aren\u2019t mounted.\nNet.\nA Large or smaller creature hit by a net\
  \ is\nrestrained until it is freed.\nA net has no effect on\ncreatures that are\
  \ formless, or creatures that are Huge\nor larger.\nA creature can use its action\
  \ to make a DC 10\nStrength check, freeing itself or another creature within\nits\
  \ reach on a success.\nDealing 5 slashing damage to the\nnet (AC 10) also frees\
  \ the creature without harming it,\nending the effect and destroying the net.\n\
  W hen you use an action, bonus action, or reaction\nto attack with a net, you can\
  \ make only one attack\nregardless of the number of attacks you can\nnormally make.\n\
  A d v e n t u r i n g G e a r\nThis section describes items that have special rules\
  \ or\nrequire further explanation.\nAcid.\nAs an action, you can splash the contents\
  \ of\nthis vial onto a creature within 5 feet of you or throw\nthe vial up to 20\
  \ feet, shattering it on impact.\nIn either\ncase, make a ranged attack against\
  \ a creature or object,\ntreating the acid as an im provised weapon.\nOn a hit,\
  \ the\ntarget takes 2d6 acid damage.\nAlchemist\u2019s Fire.\nThis sticky, adhesive\
  \ fluid ignites\nwhen exposed to air.\nAs an action, you can throw this\nflask up\

  that you are spending your time between adventures in town,\navailing yourself of\
  \ whatever services you can afford\u2014 paying\nfor food and shelter, paying townspeople\
  \ to sharpen your\nsword and repair your armor, and so on.\nSome characters,\nthough,\
  \ might prefer to spend their time away from\ncivilization, sustaining themselves\
  \ in the wild by hunting,\nforaging, and repairing their own gear.\nMaintaining\
  \ this kind of lifestyle doesn\u2019t require you to\nspend any coin, but it is\
  \ time-consuming.\nIf you spend\nyour time between adventures practicing a profession,\

  \ types of hirelings appear on\nthe Services table.\nOther com m on hirelings include\n\
  any of the wide variety of people who inhabit a typical\ntown or city, when the\
  \ adventurers pay them to\nperform a specific task.\nFor example, a wizard might\n\
  pay a carpenter to construct an elaborate chest (and\nits miniature replica) for\
  \ use in the Leomund\u2019s secret\nchest spell.\nA fighter might com m ission a\
  \ blacksmith to\nforge a special sword.\nA bard might pay a tailor to make\nexquisite\
  \ clothing for an upcom ing perform ance in\nfront of the duke.\nOther hirelings\
  \ provide m ore expert or dangerous\nservices.\nM ercenary soldiers paid to help\
  \ the\nadventurers take on a hobgoblin army are hirelings, as\nare sages hired to\
  \ research ancient or esoteric lore.\nIf a\nhigh-level adventurer establishes a\
  \ stronghold of som e\nkind, he or she might hire a whole staff of servants and\n\
  agents to run the place, from a castellan or steward\nto menial laborers to keep\
  \ the stables clean.\nThese\nhirelings often enjoy a long-term contract that includes\n\
  a place to live within the stronghold as part of the\noffered compensation.\nS e\

  category of ordinary hirelings.\nIt might be possible to\nfind som eone w illing\
  \ to cast a spell in exchange for coin\nor favors, but it is rarely easy and no\
  \ established pay\nrates exist.\nAs a rule, the higher the level of the desired\n\

  Hiring som eone to cast a relatively com m on spell\nof 1st or 2nd level, such as\

  C h a p t e r 6: C u s t o m i z a t i o n O p t i o n s\nTHE COMBINATION OF ABILITY\
  \ SCORES, RACE,\nclass, and background defines your\ncharacter\u2019s capabilities\
  \ in the game, and\nthe personal details you create set your\ncharacter apart from\
  \ every other character.\nEven within your class and race, you have\noptions to\
  \ fine-tune what your character\ncan do.\nBut this chapter is for players w ho\u2014\
  with the\nDM \u2019s perm ission\u2014want to go a step further.\nThis chapter defines\
  \ two optional sets of rules for\ncustomizing your character: multiclassing and\
  \ feats.\nMulticlassing lets you com bine classes together,\nand feats are special\
  \ options you can choose instead\nof increasing your ability scores as you gain\
  \ levels.\nYour DM decides whether these options are available\nin a campaign.\n\
  M u l t ic l a s s in g\nMulticlassing allows you to gain levels in multiple\nclasses.\n\
  Doing so lets you m ix the abilities of those\nclasses to realize a character concept\
  \ that might not be\nreflected in one of the standard class options.\nWith this\
  \ rule, you have the option of gaining a level\nin a new class whenever you advance\
  \ in level, instead\nof gaining a level in your current class.\nYour levels in\n\
  all your classes are added together to determine your\ncharacter level.\nFor example,\
  \ if you have three levels in\nwizard and two in fighter, you\u2019re a 5th-level\
  \ character.\nAs you advance in levels, you might primarily remain\na m em ber of\
  \ your original class with just a few levels\nin another class, or you might change\
  \ course entirely,\nnever looking back at the class you left behind.\nYou\nmight\
  \ even start progressing in a third or fourth class.\nCom pared to a single-class\
  \ character of the sam e level,\nyou\u2019ll sacrifice som e focus in exchange for\
  \ versatility.\nM u l t i c l a s s i n g E x a m p l e\nGary is playing a 4th-level\
  \ fighter.\nWhen his character earns\nenough experience points to reach 5th level,\
  \ Gary decides\nthat his character will multiclass instead of continuing to\nprogress\
  \ as a fighter.\nGary\u2019s fighter has been spending a lot\nof time with Dave\u2019\
  s rogue, and has even been doing some\njobs on the side for the local thieves\u2019\
  \ guild as a bruiser.\nGary\ndecides that his character will multiclass into the\
  \ rogue class,\nand thus his character becomes a 4th-level fighter and 1st-\nlevel\
  \ rogue (written as fighter 4/rogue 1).\nWhen Gary\u2019s character earns enough\
  \ experience to\nreach 6th level, he can decide whether to add another\nfighter\
  \ level (becoming a fighter 5/rogue 1), another rogue\nlevel (becoming a fighter\
  \ 4/rogue 2), or a level in a third\nclass, perhaps dabbling in wizardry thanks\
  \ to the tome of\nmysterious lore he acquired (becoming a fighter 4/rogue 1/\nwizard\
  \ 1).\nP r e r e q u i s i t e s\nTo qualify for a new class, you must meet the\
  \ ability score\nprerequisites for both your current class and your new\none, as\
  \ shown in the Multiclassing Prerequisites table.\nFor example, a barbarian w ho\
  \ decides to multiclass into\nthe druid class must have both Strength and W isdom\n\
  scores of 13 or higher.\nWithout the full training that\na beginning character receives,\
  \ you must be a quick\nstudy in your new class, having a natural aptitude that\n\
  is reflected by higher-than-average ability scores.\nM\nu l t i c l a s s i n g\n\
  P r e r e q u i s i t e s\nClass\nAbility Score Minimum\nBarbarian\nStrength 13\n\

  \ t s\nThe experience point cost to gain a level is always\nbased on your total\
  \ character level, as shown in the\nCharacter Advancement table in chapter 1, not\
  \ your level\nin a particular class.\nSo, if you are a cleric 6/fighter 1,\nyou\
  \ must gain enough X P to reach 8th level before you\ncan take your second level\
  \ as a fighter or your seventh\nlevel as a cleric.\nH i t P o i n t s a n d H i\
  \ t D i c e\nYou gain the hit points from your new class as described\nfor levels\
  \ after 1st.\nYou gain the 1st-level hit points for a\nclass only when you are a\
  \ 1st-level character.\nYou add together the Hit Dice granted by all your\nclasses\
  \ to form your pool of Hit Dice.\nIf the Hit Dice are\nthe same die type, you can\
  \ simply pool them together.\nFor example, both the fighter and the paladin have\
  \ a\nd 10, so if you are a paladin 5/fighter 5, you have ten d 10\nHit Dice.\nIf\
  \ your classes give you Hit Dice o f different\ntypes, keep track of them separately.\n\
  If you are a paladin\n5/cleric 5, for example, you have five d 10 Hit Dice and\n\
  five d8 Hit Dice.\nP r o f i c i e n c y B o n u s\nYour proficiency bonus is always\
  \ based on your total\ncharacter level, as shown in the Character Advancement\n\
  table in chapter 1, not your level in a particular class.\nFor example, if you are\
  \ a fighter 3/rogue 2, you have the\nproficiency bonus of a 5th-level character,\
  \ which is +3.\nP r o f i c i e n c i e s\nW hen you gain a level in a class other\
  \ than your first,\nyou gain only som e of that class\u2019s starting proficiencies,\n\
  as shown in the Multiclassing Proficiencies table.\nC l a s s F e a t u r e s\n\
  W hen you gain a new level in a class, you get its features\nfor that level.\nA\
  \ few features, however, have additional\nrules when you\u2019re multiclassing:\
  \ Channel Divinity, Extra\nAttack, Unarmored Defense, and Spellcasting.\nC h a n\
  \ n e l D i v i n i t y\nIf you already have the Channel Divinity feature and gain\n\
  a level in a class that also grants the feature, you gain the\nChannel Divinity\
  \ effects granted by that class, but getting\nthe feature again doesn\u2019t give\
  \ you an additional use of\nit.\nYou gain additional uses only when you reach a\
  \ class\nlevel that explicitly grants them to you.\nFor example, if\nyou are a cleric\
  \ 6/paladin 4, you can use Channel Divinity\ntwice between rests because you are\
  \ high enough level\nin the cleric class to have more uses.\nW henever you use\n\
  the feature, you can choose any of the Channel Divinity\neffects available to you\
  \ from your two classes.\nE x t r a A t t a c k\nIf you gain the Extra Attack class\
  \ feature from more\nthan one class, the features don\u2019t add together.\nYou\n\
  can\u2019t make m ore than two attacks with this feature\nunless it says you do\
  \ (as the fighter\u2019s version of Extra\nAttack does).\nSimilarly, the warlock\u2019\
  s eldritch invocation\nThirsting Blade doesn\u2019t give you additional attacks\
  \ if you\nalso have Extra Attack.\nU n a r m o r e d D e f e n s e\nIf you already\
  \ have the Unarmored Defense feature, you\ncan\u2019t gain it again from another\
  \ class.\nS p e l l c a s t i n g\nYour capacity for spellcasting depends partly\
  \ on your\ncom bined levels in all your spellcasting classes and\npartly on your\
  \ individual levels in those classes.\nOnce\nyou have the Spellcasting feature from\
  \ m ore than one\nclass, use the rules below.\nIf you multiclass but have the\n\
  Spellcasting feature from only one class, you follow the\nrules as described in\
  \ that class.\nSpells Known and Prepared.\nYou determine\nwhat spells you know and\
  \ can prepare for each class\nindividually, as if you were a single-classed mem\
  \ ber of\nthat class.\nIf you are a ranger 4/wizard 3, for example,\nyou know three\
  \ 1st-level ranger spells based on your\nlevels in the ranger class.\nAs 3rd-level\
  \ wizard, you know\nthree w izard cantrips, and your spellbook contains ten\nwizard\
  \ spells, two of which (the two you gained when\nyou reached 3rd level as a wizard)\
  \ can be 2nd-level\nspells.\nIf your Intelligence is 16, you can prepare six\nwizard\
  \ spells from your spellbook.\nEach spell you know and prepare is associated with\
  \ one\nof your classes, and you use the spellcasting ability of that\nclass when\
  \ you cast the spell.\nSimilarly, a spellcasting\nfocus, such as a holy symbol,\
  \ can be used only for the\nspells from the class associated with that focus.\n\
  Spell Slots.\nYou determine your available spell slots\nby adding together all your\
  \ levels in the bard, cleric,\ndruid, sorcerer, and wizard classes, half your levels\n\
  (rounded down) in the paladin and ranger classes, and\na third o f your fighter\
  \ or rogue levels (rounded down)\nif you have the Eldritch Knight or the Arcane\
  \ Trickster\nfeature.\nUse this total to determine your spell slots by\nconsulting\
  \ the Multiclass Spellcaster table.\nIf you have m ore than one spellcasting class,\
  \ this table\nmight give you spell slots of a level that is higher than\nthe spells\
  \ you know or can prepare.\nYou can use those\nslots, but only to cast your lower-level\
  \ spells.\nIf a lower-\nlevel spell that you cast, like burning hands, has an\n\
  enhanced effect when cast using a higher-level slot, you\ncan use the enhanced effect,\
  \ even though you don\u2019t have\nany spells of that higher level.\nFor example,\
  \ if you are the aforementioned ranger 4/\nwizard 3, you count as a 5th-level character\
  \ when\ndetermining your spell slots: you have four 1st-level\nslots, three 2nd-level\
  \ slots, and two 3rd-level slots.\nHowever, you don\u2019t know any 3rd-level spells,\
  \ nor do you\nknow any 2nd-level ranger spells.\nYou can use the spell\nslots of\
  \ those levels to cast the spells you do know\u2014and\npotentially enhance their\
  \ effects.\nPact Magic.\nIf you have both the Spellcasting class\nfeature and the\
  \ Pact Magic class feature from the warlock\nclass, you can use the spell slots\
  \ you gain from the Pact\nMagic feature to cast spells you know or have prepared\n\
  from classes with the Spellcasting class feature, and you\ncan use the spell slots\
  \ you gain from the Spellcasting\nclass feature to cast w arlock spells you know.\n\

  \ (Perform ance) checks when trying to pass\nyourself off as a different person.\n\
  \u2022 You can m im ic the speech of another person or the\nsounds made by other\

  make the sound, for at least 1 minute.\nA successful\nW isdom (Insight) check contested\

  \ is faked.\nC h a r g e r\nW hen you use your action to Dash, you can use a\nbonus\
  \ action to make one m elee weapon attack or to\nshove a creature.\nIf you move\
  \ at least 10 feet in a straight line\nimmediately before taking this bonus action,\
  \ you either\ngain a +5 bonus to the attack\u2019s damage roll (if you chose\nto\
  \ make a melee attack and hit) or push the target up\nto 10 feet away from you (if\
  \ you chose to shove and\nyou succeed).\nC r o s s b o w E x p e r t\nThanks to\

  \ You ignore the loading quality of crossbow s with\nwhich you are proficient.\n\
  \u2022 Being within 5 feet of a hostile creature doesn\u2019t\nim pose disadvantage\
  \ on your ranged attack rolls.\n\u2022 W hen you use the Attack action and attack\
  \ with a one-\nhanded weapon, you can use a bonus action to attack\nwith a loaded\
  \ hand crossbow you are holding.\nD e f e n s i v e D u e l i s t\nPrerequisite:\
  \ Dexterity 13 or higher\nW hen you are wielding a finesse weapon with which\nyou\
  \ are proficient and another creature hits you with\na melee attack, you can use\
  \ your reaction to add your\nproficiency bonus to your AC for that attack, potentially\n\
  causing the attack to m iss you.\nD u a l W i e\nl d\ne\nr\nYou master fighting\
  \ with two weapons, gaining the\nfollowing benefits:\n\u2022 You gain a +1 bonus\
  \ to AC while you are wielding a\nseparate melee weapon in each hand.\n\u2022 You\
  \ can use two-weapon fighting even when the one-\nhanded melee w eapons you are\
  \ wielding aren\u2019t light.\n\u2022 You can draw or stow two one-handed w eapons\
  \ when\nyou w ould normally be able to draw or stow only one.\nF e a t s\nA feat\
  \ represents a talent or an area of expertise that gives\na character special capabilities.\n\
  It embodies training,\nexperience, and abilities beyond what a class provides.\n\
  At certain levels, your class gives you the Ability Score\nImprovement feature.\n\
  Using the optional feats rule, you\ncan forgo taking that feature to take a feat\
  \ of your choice\ninstead.\nYou can take each feat only once, unless the\nfeat\u2019\
  s description says otherwise.\nYou must meet any prerequisite specified in a feat\n\
  to take that feat.\nIf you ever lose a feat\u2019s prerequisite,\nyou can\u2019\
  t use that feat until you regain the prerequisite.\nFor example, the Grappler feat\
  \ requires you to have a\nStrength of 13 or higher.\nIf your Strength is reduced\n\

  \ describes the\nbasic rule behind these rolls: roll a d20, add an ability\nmodifier\
  \ derived from one of the six ability scores, and\ncom pare the total to a target\

  \ magnitude of that ability.\nAn ability score\nis not just a measure of innate\
  \ capabilities, but also\nencom passes a creature\u2019s training and com petence\
  \ in\nactivities related to that ability.\nA score of 10 or 11 is the normal human\
  \ average, but\nadventurers and many monsters are a cut above average\nin most abilities.\n\
  A score of 18 is the highest that a\nperson usually reaches.\nAdventurers can have\
  \ scores\nas high as 20, and monsters and divine beings can have\nscores as high\
  \ as 30.\nEach ability also has a modifier, derived from the\nscore and ranging\
  \ from 5 (for an ability score of 1) to\n+10 (for a score of 30).\nThe Ability Scores\
  \ and M odifiers\ntable notes the ability m odifiers for the range of possible\n\

  \ d20 when you make the roll.\nUse the\nhigher of the two rolls if you have advantage,\
  \ and use\nthe lower roll if you have disadvantage.\nFor example, if\nyou have disadvantage\
  \ and roll a 17 and a 5, you use the\n5.\nIf you instead have advantage and roll\
  \ those numbers,\nyou use the 17.\nIf multiple situations affect a roll and each\

  \ you still roll only one\nadditional d20.\nIf circum stances cause a roll to have\
  \ both advantage\nand disadvantage, you are considered to have neither of\nthem,\
  \ and you roll one d20.\nThis is true even if multiple\ncircum stances im pose disadvantage\
  \ and only one grants\nadvantage or vice versa.\nIn such a situation, you have\n\
  neither advantage nor disadvantage.\nW hen you have advantage or disadvantage and\n\
  som ething in the game, such as the halfling\u2019s Lucky\ntrait, lets you reroll\
  \ the d20, you can reroll only one\nof the dice.\nYou choose which one.\nFor example,\
  \ if a\nhalfling has advantage on an ability check and rolls\na 1 and a 13, the\
  \ halfling could use the Lucky trait to\nreroll the 1.\nYou usually gain advantage\
  \ or disadvantage through\nthe use of special abilities, actions, or spells.\nInspiration\n\
  (see chapter 4) can also give a character advantage on\nchecks related to the character\u2019\
  s personality, ideals,\nor bonds.\nThe DM can also decide that circum stances\n\
  influence a roll in one direction or the other and grant\nadvantage or im pose disadvantage\
  \ as a result.\nP r o f ic ie n c y B o n u s\nCharacters have a proficiency bonus\
  \ determined by\nlevel, as detailed in chapter 1.\nMonsters also have this\nbonus,\
  \ which is incorporated in their stat blocks.\nThe\nbonus is used in the rules on\
  \ ability checks, saving\nthrows, and attack rolls.\nYour proficiency bonus can\u2019\
  t be added to a single die\nroll or other number m ore than once.\nFor example,\
  \ if\ntwo different rules say you can add your proficiency\nbonus to a W isdom saving\
  \ throw, you nevertheless add\nthe bonus only once when you make the save.\nOccasionally,\
  \ your proficiency bonus might be\nmultiplied or divided (doubled or halved, for\
  \ example)\nbefore you apply it.\nFor example, the rogue's Expertise\nfeature doubles\
  \ the proficiency bonus for certain ability\nchecks.\nIf a circum stance suggests\
  \ that your proficiency\nbonus applies m ore than once to the sam e roll, you still\n\
  add it only once and multiply or divide it only once.\nBy the sam e token, if a\
  \ feature or effect allows you\nto multiply your proficiency bonus when making an\n\
  ability check that w ouldn\u2019t normally benefit from your\nproficiency bonus,\
  \ you still don\u2019t add the bonus to the\ncheck.\nFor that check your proficiency\
  \ bonus is 0, given\nthe fact that multiplying 0 by any number is still 0.\nFor\n\
  instance, if you lack proficiency in the History skill,\nyou gain no benefit from\
  \ a feature that lets you double\nyour proficiency bonus when you make Intelligence\n\
  (History) checks.\nIn general, you don\u2019t multiply your proficiency bonus\n\
  for attack rolls or saving throws.\nIf a feature or effect\nallows you to do so,\
  \ these same rules apply.\nA b i l i t y C h e c k s\nAn ability check tests a character\u2019\
  s or monster\u2019s innate\ntalent and training in an effort to overcom e a challenge.\n\
  The DM calls for an ability check when a character or\nmonster attempts an action\
  \ (other than an attack) that\nhas a chance of failure.\nW hen the outcom e is uncertain,\n\
  the dice determine the results.\nFor every ability check, the DM decides which of\
  \ the six\nabilities is relevant to the task at hand and the difficulty\nof the\
  \ task, represented by a Difficulty Class.\nThe more\ndifficult a task, the higher\
  \ its DC.\nThe Typical Difficulty\nClasses table show s the most com m on DCs.\n\
  T y p i c a l D i f f i c u l t y C l a s s e s\nTask Difficulty\nDC\nVery easy\n\
  5\nEasy\n10\nMedium\n15\nHard\n20\nVery hard\n25\nNearly impossible\n30\nTo make\
  \ an ability check, roll a d20 and add the\nrelevant ability modifier.\nAs with\
  \ other d20 rolls, apply\nbonuses and penalties, and com pare the total to the DC.\n\
  If the total equals or exceeds the DC, the ability check\nis a success\u2014the\
  \ creature overcom es the challenge\nat hand.\nOtherwise, it\u2019s a failure, which\
  \ means the\ncharacter or monster makes no progress toward the\nobjective or makes\
  \ progress com bined with a setback\ndetermined by the DM.\nC o n t e s t s _______________________________\n\
  Som etim es one character\u2019s or monster\u2019s efforts are\ndirectly opposed\
  \ to another\u2019s.\nThis can occur when both\nof them are trying to do the sam\
  \ e thing and only one\ncan succeed, such as attempting to snatch up a magic\nring\
  \ that has fallen on the floor.\nThis situation also\napplies when one of them is\
  \ trying to prevent the other\none from accom plishing a goal\u2014for example,\
  \ when a\nmonster tries to force open a door that an adventurer\nis holding closed.\n\
  In situations like these, the outcome\nis determined by a special form of ability\
  \ check,\ncalled a contest.\nBoth participants in a contest make ability checks\n\
  appropriate to their efforts.\nThey apply all appropriate\nbonuses and penalties,\
  \ but instead o f com paring the\ntotal to a DC, they com pare the totals of their\
  \ two\nchecks.\nThe participant with the higher check total wins\nthe contest.\n\
  That character or monster either succeeds\nat the action or prevents the other one\
  \ from succeeding.\nIf the contest results in a tie, the situation remains the\n\
  same as it was before the contest.\nThus, one contestant\nmight win the contest\
  \ by default.\nIf two characters tie in\na contest to snatch a ring off the floor,\
  \ neither character\ngrabs it.\nIn a contest between a monster trying to open\n\
  a door and an adventurer trying to keep the door closed,\na tie means that the door\
  \ remains shut.\nSk i l l s\nEach ability covers a broad range of capabilities,\n\
  including skills that a character or a monster can be\nproficient in.\nA skill represents\
  \ a specific aspect of an\nability score, and an individual\u2019s proficiency in\
  \ a skill\ndemonstrates a focus on that aspect. (A character\u2019s\nstarting skill\
  \ proficiencies are determined at character\ncreation, and a monster\u2019s skill\
  \ proficiencies appear in\nthe monster\u2019s stat block.)\nFor example, a Dexterity\
  \ check might reflect a\ncharacter\u2019s attempt to pull off an acrobatic stunt,\
  \ to palm\nan object, or to stay hidden.\nEach of these aspects of\nDexterity has\
  \ an associated skill: Acrobatics, Sleight of\nHand, and Stealth, respectively.\n\
  S o a character w ho has\nproficiency in the Stealth skill is particularly good\
  \ at\nDexterity checks related to sneaking and hiding.\nThe skills related to each\
  \ ability score are shown in\nthe following list. (No skills are related to Constitution.)\n\
  S ee an ability\u2019s description in the later sections o f this\nchapter for examples\
  \ of how to use a skill associated\nwith an ability.\nSom etim es, the DM might\
  \ ask for an ability check\nusing a specific skill\u2014for example, \u201CMake\
  \ a W isdom\n(Perception) check.\u201D At other times, a player might ask\nthe DM\
  \ if proficiency in a particular skill applies to a\ncheck.\nIn either case, proficiency\
  \ in a skill means an\nindividual can add his or her proficiency bonus to ability\n\
  checks that involve that skill.\nWithout proficiency in the\nskill, the individual\
  \ makes a normal ability check.\nStrength\nAthletics\nDexterity\nAcrobatics\nSleight\

  Intimidation\nPerform ance\nPersuasion\nFor example, if a character attempts to\
  \ clim b up a\ndangerous cliff, the Dungeon Master might ask for a\nStrength (Athletics)\
  \ check.\nIf the character is proficient\nin Athletics, the character\u2019s proficiency\
  \ bonus is added\nto the Strength check.\nIf the character lacks that\nproficiency,\
  \ he or she just makes a Strength check.\nV a r i a n t : S k i l l s w i t h D\
  \ i f f e r e n t A b i l i t i e s\nNormally, your proficiency in a skill applies\
  \ only to a\nspecific kind of ability check.\nProficiency in Athletics,\nfor example,\
  \ usually applies to Strength checks.\nIn som e\nsituations, though, your proficiency\
  \ might reasonably\napply to a different kind of check.\nIn such cases, the DM\n\
  might ask for a check using an unusual combination of\nability and skill, or you\
  \ might ask your DM if you can\napply a proficiency to a different check.\nFor example,\n\
  if you have to swim from an offshore island to the\nmainland, your DM might call\
  \ for a Constitution check\nto see if you have the stamina to make it that far.\n\
  In this\ncase, your DM might allow you to apply your proficiency\nin Athletics and\
  \ ask for a Constitution (Athletics) check.\nS o if you\u2019re proficient in Athletics,\
  \ you apply your\nproficiency bonus to the Constitution check just as you\nwould\
  \ normally do for a Strength (Athletics) check.\nSimilarly, when your half-orc barbarian\
  \ uses a display\nof raw strength to intimidate an enemy, your DM might\nask for\
  \ a Strength (Intimidation) check, even though\nIntimidation is normally associated\
  \ with Charisma.\nPa s s iv e C h e c k s\nA passive check is a special kind of\
  \ ability check that\ndoesn\u2019t involve any die rolls.\nSuch a check can represent\n\
  the average result for a task done repeatedly, such as\nsearching for secret doors\
  \ over and over again, or can\nbe used when the DM wants to secretly determine\n\
  whether the characters succeed at som ething without\nrolling dice, such as noticing\
  \ a hidden monster.\nHere\u2019s how to determine a character\u2019s total for a\n\
  passive check:\n10 + all modifiers that normally apply to the check\nIf the character\
  \ has advantage on the check, add 5.\nFor\ndisadvantage, subtract 5.\nThe game refers\
  \ to a passive\ncheck total as a score.\nFor example, if a 1st-level character has\
  \ a W isdom of\n15 and proficiency in Perception, he or she has a passive\nW isdom\
  \ (Perception) score of 14.\nThe rules on hiding in the \u201CDexterity\u201D section\
  \ below\nrely on passive checks, as do the exploration rules\nin chapter 8.\nW o\
  \ r k i n g T o g e t h e r\nSom etim es two or m ore characters team up to attempt\
  \ a\ntask.\nThe character w ho\u2019s leading the effort\u2014or the one\nwith the\
  \ highest ability m odifier\u2014can make an ability\ncheck with advantage, reflecting\
  \ the help provided by\nthe other characters.\nIn combat, this requires the Help\n\
  action (see chapter 9).\nA character can only provide help if the task is one that\n\
  he or she could attempt alone.\nFor example, trying to\nopen a lock requires proficiency\
  \ with thieves\u2019 tools, so a\ncharacter who lacks that proficiency can\u2019\
  t help another\ncharacter in that task.\nMoreover, a character can help\nonly when\
  \ two or more individuals working together\nwould actually be productive.\nSom e\
  \ tasks, such as\nthreading a needle, are no easier with help.\nG r o u p C h e\
  \ c k s\nW hen a number of individuals are trying to accom plish\nsom ething as\
  \ a group, the DM might ask for a group\nability check.\nIn such a situation, the\
  \ characters w ho are\nskilled at a particular task help cover those w ho aren't.\n\
  To make a group ability check, everyone in the group\nm akes the ability check.\n\
  If at least half the group\nsucceeds, the whole group succeeds.\nOtherwise,\nthe\
  \ group fails.\nGroup checks don\u2019t com e up very often, and they\u2019re\n\
  most useful when all the characters succeed or\nfail as a group.\nFor example, when\
  \ adventurers are\nnavigating a swamp, the DM might call for a group\nW isdom (Survival)\
  \ check to see if the characters can\navoid the quicksand, sinkholes, and other\
  \ natural\nhazards o f the environment.\nIf at least half the group\nsucceeds, the\
  \ successful characters are able to guide\ntheir com panions out of danger.\nOtherwise,\
  \ the group\nstumbles into one o f these hazards.\nU s in g Ea c h A b il i t y\n\
  Every task that a character or monster might attempt\nin the game is covered by\
  \ one of the six abilities.\nThis\nsection explains in m ore detail what those abilities\n\
  mean and the ways they are used in the game.\nSt r e n g t h\nStrength m easures\
  \ bodily power, athletic training, and\nthe extent to which you can exert raw physical\
  \ force.\nSt r e n g t h C h e c k s\nA Strength check can m odel any attempt to\
  \ lift, push,\npull, or break something, to force your body through a\nspace, or\
  \ to otherwise apply brute force to a situation.\nThe Athletics skill reflects aptitude\
  \ in certain kinds of\nStrength checks.\nAthletics.\nYour Strength (Athletics) check\
  \ covers\ndifficult situations you encounter while climbing,\njumping, or swimming.\n\
  Examples include the\nfollowing activities:\n\u2022 You attempt to climb a sheer\
  \ or slippery cliff, avoid\nhazards while scaling a wall, or cling to a surface\n\
  while som ething is trying to knock you off.\n\u2022 You try to jum p an unusually\
  \ long distance or pull\noff a stunt midjump.\n\u2022 You struggle to swim or stay\
  \ afloat in treacherous cur\xAD\nrents, storm -tossed waves, or areas o f thick\
  \ seaweed.\nOr another creature tries to push or pull you underwa\xAD\nter or otherwise\
  \ interfere with your swimming.\nOther Strength Checks.\nThe DM might also call\
  \ for\na Strength check when you try to accom plish tasks like\nthe following:\n\
  \u2022 Force open a stuck, locked, or barred door\n\u2022 Break free of bonds\n\u2022\
  \ Push through a tunnel that is too small\n\u2022 Hang on to a wagon while being\
  \ dragged behind it\n\u2022 Tip over a statue\n\u2022 Keep a boulder from rolling\n\
  A t t a c k R o l l s a n d D a m a g e\nYou add your Strength m odifier to your\
  \ attack roll and\nyour damage roll when attacking with a melee weapon\nsuch as\
  \ a mace, a battleaxe, or a javelin.\nYou use\nmelee w eapons to make melee attacks\
  \ in hand-to-hand\ncombat, and som e of them can be thrown to make a\nranged attack.\n\
  L i f t i n g a n d C a r r y i n g\nYour Strength score determines the amount of\
  \ weight\nyou can bear.\nThe following terms define what you can\nlift or carry.\n\
  Carrying Capacity.\nYour carrying capacity is your\nStrength score multiplied by\
  \ 15.\nThis is the weight (in\npounds) that you can carry, which is high enough\
  \ that\nmost characters don\u2019t usually have to worry about it.\nPush, Drag,\
  \ or Lift.\nYou can push, drag, or lift a\nweight in pounds up to twice your carrying\
  \ capacity\n(or 30 times your Strength score).\nW hile pushing or\ndragging weight\
  \ in excess of your carrying capacity,\nyour speed drops to 5 feet.\nSize and Strength.\n\
  Larger creatures can bear m ore\nweight, whereas Tiny creatures can carry less.\n\
  For\neach size category above Medium, double the creature\u2019s\ncarrying capacity\
  \ and the amount it can push, drag, or\nlift.\nFor a Tiny creature, halve these\
  \ weights.\nDexterity m easures agility, reflexes, and balance.\nD e x t e r i t\
  \ y C h e c k s\nA Dexterity check can model any attempt to move\nnimbly, quickly,\
  \ or quietly, or to keep from falling\non tricky footing.\nThe Acrobatics, Sleight\
  \ of Hand,\nand Stealth skills reflect aptitude in certain kinds of\nDexterity checks.\n\
  Acrobatics.\nYour Dexterity (Acrobatics) check covers\nyour attempt to stay on your\
  \ feet in a tricky situation,\nsuch as when you\u2019re trying to run across a sheet\
  \ o f ice,\nbalance on a tightrope, or stay upright on a rocking\nship\u2019s deck.\n\
  The DM might also call for a Dexterity\n(Acrobatics) check to see if you can perform\
  \ acrobatic\nstunts, including dives, rolls, somersaults, and flips.\nV a r i a\
  \ n t : E n c u m b r a n c e\nThe rules for lifting and carrying are intentionally\n\
  simple.\nHere is a variant if you are looking for m ore\ndetailed rules for determining\
  \ how a character is\nhindered by the weight of equipment.\nW hen you use this\n\
  variant, ignore the Strength colum n of the Arm or table\nin chapter 5.\nIf you\
  \ carry weight in excess of 5 times your Strength\nscore, you are encumbered, which\
  \ means your speed\ndrops by 10 feet.\nIf you carry weight in excess of 10 times\
  \ your\nStrength score, up to your m aximum carrying capacity,\nyou are instead\
  \ heavily encumbered, which means your\nspeed drops by 20 feet and you have disadvantage\
  \ on\nability checks, attack rolls, and saving throws that use\nStrength, Dexterity,\
  \ or Constitution.\nD e x t e r i t y\nSleight of Hand.\nW henever you attempt an\
  \ act of\nlegerdemain or manual trickery, such as planting\nsom ething on som eone\
  \ else or concealing an object on\nyour person, make a Dexterity (Sleight o f Hand)\
  \ check.\nThe DM might also call for a Dexterity (Sleight of Hand)\ncheck to determine\
  \ whether you can lift a coin purse off\nanother person or slip som ething out of\
  \ another\nperson\u2019s pocket.\nStealth.\nMake a Dexterity (Stealth) check when\
  \ you\nattempt to conceal yourself from enemies, slink past\nguards, slip away without\
  \ being noticed, or sneak up on\nsom eone without being seen or heard.\nOther Dexterity\
  \ Checks.\nThe DM might call for a\nDexterity check when you try to accom plish\
  \ tasks like\nthe following:\n\u2022 Control a heavily laden cart on a steep descent\n\
  \u2022 Steer a chariot around a tight turn\n\u2022 Pick a lock\n\u2022 Disable a\
  \ trap\n\u2022 Securely tie up a prisoner\n\u2022 W riggle free of bonds\n\u2022\
  \ Play a stringed instrument\n\u2022 Craft a small or detailed object\nA t t a c\
  \ k R o l l s a n d D a m a g e\nYou add your Dexterity modifier to your attack\
  \ roll and\nyour damage roll when attacking with a ranged weapon,\nsuch as a sling\
  \ or a longbow.\nYou can also add your\nDexterity m odifier to your attack roll\
  \ and your damage\nroll when attacking with a melee w eapon that has the\nfinesse\
  \ property, such as a dagger or a rapier.\nH i d i n g\nWhen you try to hide, make\
  \ a Dexterity (Stealth) check.\nUntil\nyou are discovered or you stop hiding, that\
  \ check\u2019s total is\ncontested by the Wisdom (Perception) check of any creature\n\
  that actively searches for signs of your presence.\nYou can\u2019t hide from a creature\
  \ that can see you, and if you\nmake noise (such as shouting a warning or knocking\
  \ over a\nvase), you give away your position.\nAn invisible creature can\u2019t\n\
  be seen, so it can always try to hide.\nSigns of its passage\nmight still be noticed,\
  \ however, and it still has to stay quiet.\nIn combat, most creatures stay alert\
  \ for signs of danger\nall around, so if you come out of hiding and approach\na\
  \ creature, it usually sees you.\nHowever, under certain\ncircumstances, the Dungeon\
  \ Master might allow you to stay\nhidden as you approach a creature that is distracted,\
  \ allowing\nyou to gain advantage on an attack before you are seen.\nPassive Perception.\n\
  When you hide, there\u2019s a chance\nsomeone will notice you even if they aren't\
  \ searching.\nTo\ndetermine whether such a creature notices you, the DM\ncompares\
  \ your Dexterity (Stealth) check with that creature\u2019s\npassive Wisdom (Perception)\
  \ score, which equals 10 + the\ncreature\u2019s Wisdom modifier, as well as any\
  \ other bonuses\nor penalties.\nIf the creature has advantage, add 5.\nFor\ndisadvantage,\
  \ subtract 5.\nFor example, if a 1st-level character (with a proficiency\nbonus\
  \ o f +2) has a Wisdom of 15 (a +2 modifier) and\nproficiency in Perception, he\
  \ or she has a passive Wisdom\n(Perception) of 14.\nWhat Can You See?\nOne of the\
  \ main factors in determining\nwhether you can find a hidden creature or object\
  \ is how well\nyou can see in an area, which might be lightly or heavily\nobscured,\
  \ as explained in chapter 8.\nA r m o r G l a s s\nDepending on the armor you wear,\
  \ you might add som e\nor all of your Dexterity m odifier to your Arm or Class,\n\
  as described in chapter 5.\nI n i t i a t i v e\nAt the beginning of every combat,\
  \ you roll initiative\nby making a Dexterity check.\nInitiative determines\nthe\
  \ order of creatures\u2019 turns in combat, as described\nin chapter 9.\nC o n s\
  \ t i t u t i o n\nConstitution m easures health, stamina, and vital force.\nC o\
  \ n s t i t u t i o n C h e c k s\nConstitution checks are uncom m on, and no skills\
  \ apply\nto Constitution checks, because the endurance this\nability represents\
  \ is largely passive rather than involving\na specific effort on the part of a character\
  \ or monster.\nA Constitution check can m odel your attempt to push\nbeyond normal\
  \ limits, however.\nThe DM might call for a Constitution check when you\ntry to\
  \ accom plish tasks like the following:\n\u2022 Hold your breath\n\u2022 March or\
  \ labor for hours without rest\n\u2022 Go without sleep\n\u2022 Survive without\
  \ food or water\n\u2022 Quaff an entire stein of ale in one go\nH i t P o i n t\
  \ s\nYour Constitution modifier contributes to your hit\npoints.\nTypically, you\
  \ add your Constitution modifier to\neach Hit Die you roll for your hit points.\n\
  If your Constitution m odifier changes, your hit point\nmaximum changes as well,\
  \ as though you had the new\nmodifier from 1st level.\nFor example, if you raise\
  \ your\nConstitution score when you reach 4th level and your\nConstitution m odifier\
  \ increases from +1 to +2, you\nadjust your hit point maximum as though the modifier\n\
  had always been +2.\nS o you add 3 hit points for your\nfirst three levels, and\
  \ then roll your hit points for 4th\nlevel using your new modifier.\nOr if you\u2019\
  re 7th level and\nsom e effect lowers your Constitution score so as to\nreduce your\
  \ Constitution m odifier by 1, your hit point\nmaximum is reduced by 7.\nI n t e\
  \ l l i g e n c e\nIntelligence m easures mental acuity, accuracy of recall,\nand\
  \ the ability to reason.\nI n t e l l i g e n c e C h e c k s\nAn Intelligence check\
  \ com es into play when you need\nto draw on logic, education, memory, or deductive\n\
  reasoning.\nThe Arcana, History, Investigation, Nature,\nand Religion skills reflect\
  \ aptitude in certain kinds of\nIntelligence checks.\nArcana.\nYour Intelligence\
  \ (Arcana) check m easures\nyour ability to recall lore about spells, magic items,\n\
  eldritch symbols, magical traditions, the planes of\nexistence, and the inhabitants\
  \ of those planes.\nHistory.\nYour Intelligence (History) check m easures\nyour\
  \ ability to recall lore about historical events,\nlegendary people, ancient kingdom\
  \ s, past disputes,\nrecent wars, and lost civilizations.\nInvestigation.\nW hen\
  \ you look around for clues and\nmake deductions based on those clues, you make\
  \ an\nIntelligence (Investigation) check.\nYou might deduce the\nlocation of a hidden\
  \ object, discern from the appearance\no f a wound what kind of weapon dealt it,\
  \ or determine\nthe weakest point in a tunnel that could cause it to\ncollapse.\n\
  Poring through ancient scrolls in search of\na hidden fragment of knowledge might\
  \ also call for an\nIntelligence (Investigation) check.\nNature.\nYour Intelligence\
  \ (Nature) check m easures\nyour ability to recall lore about terrain, plants and\n\
  animals, the weather, and natural cycles.\nReligion.\nYour Intelligence (Religion)\
  \ check m easures\nyour ability to recall lore about deities, rites and prayers,\n\
  religious hierarchies, holy symbols, and the practices\nof secret cults.\nOther\
  \ Intelligence Checks.\nThe DM might call for an\nIntelligence check when you try\
  \ to accom plish tasks like\nthe following:\n\u2022 Communicate with a creature\
  \ without using words\n\u2022 Estimate the value of a precious item\n\u2022 Pull\
  \ together a disguise to pass as a city guard\n\u2022 Forge a docum ent\n\u2022\
  \ Recall lore about a craft or trade\n\u2022 W in a game of skill\nS p e l l c a\
  \ s t i n g A b i l i t y\nW izards use Intelligence as their spellcasting ability,\n\
  which helps determine the saving throw DCs of\nspells they cast.\nW i s d o m\n\
  W isdom reflects how attuned you are to the world\naround you and represents perceptiveness\
  \ and intuition.\nW i s d o m C h e c k s\nA W isdom check might reflect an effort\
  \ to read body\nlanguage, understand som eone\u2019s feelings, notice things\nabout\
  \ the environment, or care for an injured person.\nThe Animal Handling, Insight,\
  \ Medicine, Perception,\nand Survival skills reflect aptitude in certain kinds of\n\
  W isdom checks.\nAnimal Handling.\nW hen there is any question\nwhether you can\
  \ calm down a domesticated animal,\nkeep a mount from getting spooked, or intuit\
  \ an animal\u2019s\nintentions, the DM might call for a W isdom (Animal\nHandling)\
  \ check.\nYou also make a W isdom (Animal\nHandling) check to control your mount\
  \ when you attempt\na risky maneuver.\nInsight.\nYour W isdom (Insight) check decides\
  \ whether\nyou can determine the true intentions of a creature, such\nas w hen searching\
  \ out a lie or predicting som eone\u2019s\nnext move.\nDoing so involves gleaning\
  \ clues from body\nlanguage, speech habits, and changes in mannerisms.\nMedicine.\n\
  A W isdom (Medicine) check lets you try to\nstabilize a dying com panion or diagnose\
  \ an illness.\nPerception.\nYour W isdom (Perception) check lets\nyou spot, hear,\
  \ or otherwise detect the presence of\nsomething.\nIt m easures your general awareness\
  \ of\nyour surroundings and the keenness of your senses.\nF i n d i n g a H i d\
  \ d e n O b j e c t\nWhen your character searches for a hidden object such as\n\
  a secret door or a trap, the DM typically asks you to make a\nWisdom (Perception)\
  \ check.\nSuch a check can be used to find\nhidden details or other information\
  \ and clues that you might\notherwise overlook.\nIn most cases, you need to describe\
  \ where you are looking\nin order for the DM to determine your chance of success.\n\
  For\nexample, a key is hidden beneath a set of folded clothes in\nthe top drawer\
  \ of a bureau.\nIf you tell the DM that you pace\naround the room, looking at the\
  \ walls and furniture for clues,\nyou have no chance of finding the key, regardless\
  \ of your\nWisdom (Perception) check result.\nYou would have to specify\nthat you\
  \ were opening the drawers or searching the bureau in\norder to have any chance\
  \ of success.\nFor example, you might try to hear a conversation\nthrough a closed\
  \ door, eavesdrop under an open window,\nor hear monsters moving stealthily in the\
  \ forest.\nOr you\nmight try to spot things that are obscured or easy to\nmiss,\
  \ whether they are orcs lying in ambush on a road,\nthugs hiding in the shadows\
  \ of an alley, or candlelight\nunder a closed secret door.\nSurvival.\nThe DM might\
  \ ask you to make a W isdom\n(Survival) check to follow tracks, hunt wild game,\
  \ guide\nyour group through frozen wastelands, identify signs\nthat owlbears live\
  \ nearby, predict the weather, or avoid\nquicksand and other natural hazards.\n\
  Other Wisdom Checks.\nThe DM might call for a\nW isdom check when you try to accom\
  \ plish tasks like\nthe following:\n\u2022 Get a gut feeling about what course of\
  \ action to follow\n\u2022 Discern whether a seem ingly dead or living creature\n\
  is undead\nS p e l l c a s t i n g A b i l i t y\nClerics, druids, and rangers use\
  \ W isdom as their\nspellcasting ability, which helps determine the saving\nthrow\
  \ DCs of spells they cast.\nC h a r i s m a\nCharisma m easures your ability to\
  \ interact effectively\nwith others.\nIt includes such factors as confidence\nand\
  \ eloquence, and it can represent a charm ing or\ncom m anding personality.\nC h\
  \ a r i s m a C h e c k s\nA Charisma check might arise when you try to influence\n\
  or entertain others, when you try to make an impression\nor tell a convincing lie,\
  \ or when you are navigating a\ntricky social situation.\nThe Deception, Intimidation,\n\
  Perform ance, and Persuasion skills reflect aptitude in\ncertain kinds of Charisma\
  \ checks.\nDeception.\nYour Charisma (Deception) check\ndetermines whether you can\
  \ convincingly hide the\ntruth, either verbally or through your actions.\nThis\n\
  deception can encom pass everything from misleading\nothers through ambiguity to\
  \ telling outright lies.\nTypical\nsituations include trying to fast-talk a guard,\
  \ con a\nmerchant, earn money through gambling, pass yourself\noff in a disguise,\
  \ dull som eone\u2019s suspicions with false\nassurances, or maintain a straight\
  \ face while telling\na blatant lie.\nIntimidation.\nW hen you attempt to influence\
  \ som eone\nthrough overt threats, hostile actions, and physical\nviolence, the\
  \ DM might ask you to make a Charisma\n(Intimidation) check.\nExamples include trying\
  \ to pry\ninformation out of a prisoner, convincing street thugs\nto back down from\
  \ a confrontation, or using the edge of\na broken bottle to convince a sneering\
  \ vizier to\nreconsider a decision.\nPerformance.\nYour Charisma (Perform ance)\
  \ check\ndetermines how well you can delight an audience with\nmusic, dance, acting,\
  \ storytelling, or som e other form of\nentertainment.\nPersuasion.\nW hen you attempt\
  \ to influence som eone\nor a group o f people with tact, social graces, or good\n\
  nature, the DM might ask you to make a Charisma\n(Persuasion) check.\nTypically,\
  \ you use persuasion when\nacting in good faith, to foster friendships, make cordial\n\
  requests, or exhibit proper etiquette.\nExamples of\npersuading others include convincing\
  \ a chamberlain to\nlet your party see the king, negotiating peace between\nwarring\
  \ tribes, or inspiring a crowd of townsfolk.\nOther Charisma Checks.\nThe DM might\
  \ call for a\nCharisma check when you try to accom plish tasks like\nthe following:\n\
  \u2022 Find the best person to talk to for news, rumors,\nand gossip\n\u2022 Blend\
  \ into a crowd to get the sense o f key topics\no f conversation\nS p e l l c a\
  \ s t i n g A b i l i t y\nBards, paladins, sorcerers, and w arlocks use Charisma\n\
  as their spellcasting ability, which helps determine the\nsaving throw DCs of spells\
  \ they cast.\nSa v in g T h r o w s\nA saving throw\u2014also called a save\u2014\
  represents an\nattempt to resist a spell, a trap, a poison, a disease, or\na similar\
  \ threat.\nYou don\u2019t normally decide to make a\nsaving throw; you are forced\
  \ to make one because your\ncharacter or monster is at risk of harm.\nTo make a\
  \ saving throw, roll a d20 and add the\nappropriate ability modifier.\nFor example,\
  \ you use your\nDexterity modifier for a Dexterity saving throw.\nA saving throw\
  \ can be modified by a situational\nbonus or penalty and can be affected by advantage\n\
  and disadvantage, as determined by the DM.\nEach class gives proficiency in at least\
  \ two saving\nthrows.\nThe wizard, for example, is proficient\nin Intelligence saves.\n\
  As with skill proficiencies,\nproficiency in a saving throw lets a character add\
  \ his\nor her proficiency bonus to saving throws made using\na particular ability\
  \ score.\nSom e monsters have saving\nthrow proficiencies as well.\nThe Difficulty\
  \ Class for a saving throw is determined\nby the effect that causes it.\nFor example,\
  \ the DC for a\nsaving throw allowed by a spell is determined by the\ncaster\u2019\
  s spellcasting ability and proficiency bonus.\nThe result of a successful or failed\
  \ saving throw is\nalso detailed in the effect that allows the save.\nUsually,\n\
  a successful save m eans that a creature suffers no\nharm, or reduced harm, from\
  \ an effect.\nC h a p t e r 8: A d v e n t u r i n g\nDELVING INTO THE ANCIENT TOMB\
  \ OF HORRORS.\nslipping through the back alleys of\nWaterdeep, hacking a fresh trail\
  \ through\nthe thick jungles on the Isle of Dread\u2014these\nare the things that\
  \ D u n g e o n s & D r a g o n s\nadventures are made of.\nYour character in\n\
  the game might explore forgotten ruins and\nuncharted lands, uncover dark secrets\
  \ and sinister\nplots, and slay foul monsters.\nAnd if all goes well, your\ncharacter\
  \ will survive to claim rich rewards before\nembarking on a new adventure.\nThis\
  \ chapter covers the basics of the adventuring life,\nfrom the m echanics of movement\
  \ to the complexities of\nsocial interaction.\nThe rules for resting are also in\
  \ this\nchapter, along with a discussion of the activities your\ncharacter might\
  \ pursue between adventures.\nW hether adventurers are exploring a dusty dungeon\n\
  or the com plex relationships of a royal court, the game\nfollows a natural rhythm,\
  \ as outlined in the book\u2019s\nintroduction:\n1.\nThe DM describes the environment.\n\
  2.\nThe players describe what they want to do.\n3.\nThe DM narrates the results\
  \ of their actions.\nTypically, the DM uses a map as an outline of the\nadventure,\
  \ tracking the characters\u2019 progress as they\nexplore dungeon corridors or wilderness\
  \ regions.\nThe DM \u2019s notes, including a key to the map, describe\nwhat the\
  \ adventurers find as they enter each new area.\nSom etim es, the passage of time\
  \ and the adventurers\u2019\nactions determine what happens, so the DM might\nuse\
  \ a timeline or a flowchart to track their progress\ninstead of a map.\nT im e\n\
  In situations where keeping track of the passage of\ntime is important, the DM determines\
  \ the time a task\nrequires.\nThe DM might use a different time scale\ndepending\
  \ on the context of the situation at hand.\nIn\na dungeon environment, the adventurers\u2019\
  \ movement\nhappens on a scale of minutes.\nIt takes them about a\nminute to creep\
  \ down a long hallway, another minute\nto check for traps on the door at the end\
  \ of the hall, and\na good ten minutes to search the cham ber beyond for\nanything\
  \ interesting or valuable.\nIn a city or wilderness, a scale of hours is often more\n\
  appropriate.\nAdventurers eager to reach the lonely tower\nat the heart of the forest\
  \ hurry across those fifteen miles\nin just under four hours\u2019 time.\nFor long\
  \ journeys, a scale of days works best.\nFollowing the road from Baldur\u2019s Gate\
  \ to Waterdeep, the\nadventurers spend four uneventful days before a goblin\nambush\
  \ interrupts their journey.\nIn combat and other fast-paced situations, the game\n\
  relies on rounds, a 6-second span of time described\nin chapter 9.\nM o v e m e\
  \ n t\nSwim m ing across a rushing river, sneaking down a\ndungeon corridor, scaling\
  \ a treacherous mountain s lo p e -\nall sorts of movement play a key role in D&D\
  \ adventures.\nThe DM can sum m arize the adventurers\u2019 movement\nwithout calculating\
  \ exact distances or travel times: \u201CYou\ntravel through the forest and find\
  \ the dungeon entrance\nlate in the evening of the third day.\u201D Even in a dungeon,\n\
  particularly a large dungeon or a cave network, the\nDM can summ arize movement\
  \ between encounters:\n\u201CAfter killing the guardian at the entrance to the ancient\n\
  dwarven stronghold, you consult your map, which leads\nyou through miles of echoing\
  \ corridors to a chasm\nbridged by a narrow stone arch.\u201D\nSom etim es it\u2019\
  s important, though, to know how long\nit takes to get from one spot to another,\
  \ whether the\nanswer is in days, hours, or minutes.\nThe rules for\ndetermining\
  \ travel time depend on two factors: the\nspeed and travel pace of the creatures\
  \ moving and the\nterrain they're moving over.\nS p e e d\nEvery character and monster\
  \ has a speed, which is\nthe distance in feet that the character or monster\ncan\
  \ walk in 1 round.\nThis number assum es short\nbursts of energetic movement in\
  \ the midst of a life-\nthreatening situation.\nThe following rules determine how\
  \ far a character\nor monster can move in a minute, an hour, or a day.\nT r a v\
  \ e l Pa c e\nW hile traveling, a group of adventurers can move at a\nnormal, fast,\
  \ or slow pace, as shown on the Travel Pace\ntable.\nThe table states how far the\
  \ party can move in a\nperiod of time and whether the pace has any effect.\nA\n\
  fast pace m akes characters less perceptive, while a slow\npace makes it possible\
  \ to sneak around and to search an\narea m ore carefully (see the \u201CActivity\
  \ W hile Traveling\u201D\nsection later in this chapter for m ore information).\n\
  Forced March.\nThe Travel Pace table assum es that\ncharacters travel for 8 hours\
  \ in day.\nThey can push on\nbeyond that limit, at the risk of exhaustion.\nFor\
  \ each additional hour of travel beyond 8 hours,\nthe characters cover the distance\
  \ shown in the Hour\ncolum n for their pace, and each character must make\na Constitution\
  \ saving throw at the end of the hour.\nThe\nDC is 10 + 1 for each hour past 8 hours.\n\
  On a failed\nsaving throw, a character suffers one level of exhaustion\n(see appendix\
  \ A).\nMounts and Vehicles.\nFor short spans of time (up\nto an hour), many animals\
  \ move much faster than\nhumanoids.\nA mounted character can ride at a gallop\n\
  for about an hour, covering twice the usual distance for\na fast pace.\nIf fresh\
  \ mounts are available every 8 to 10\nmiles, characters can cover larger distances\
  \ at this pace,\nbut this is very rare except in densely populated areas.\nCharacters\
  \ in wagons, carriages, or other land\nvehicles choose a pace as normal.\nCharacters\
  \ in a\nwaterborne vessel are limited to the speed of the vessel\n(see chapter 5),\
  \ and they don\u2019t suffer penalties for a fast\npace or gain benefits from a\
  \ slow pace.\nDepending on\nthe vessel and the size of the crew, ships might be\
  \ able\nto travel for up to 24 hours per day.\nCertain special mounts, such as a\
  \ pegasus or griffon,\nor special vehicles, such as a carpet of flying, allow you\n\
  to travel m ore swiftly.\nThe Dungeon Master\u2019s Guide\ncontains m ore information\
  \ on special m ethods of travel.\nD i f f i c u l t T e r r a i n\nThe travel speeds\
  \ given in the Travel Pace table\nassume relatively simple terrain: roads, open\
  \ plains,\nor clear dungeon corridors.\nBut adventurers often face\ndense forests,\
  \ deep swamps, rubble-filled ruins, steep\nmountains, and ice-covered ground\u2014\
  all considered\ndifficult terrain.\nYou move at half speed in difficult terrain\u2014\
  moving\n1 foot in difficult terrain costs 2 feet of speed\u2014so you\ncan cover\
  \ only half the normal distance in a minute,\nan hour, or a day.\nS p e c i a l\
  \ T y p e s o f M o v e m e n t\nMovement through dangerous dungeons or wilderness\n\
  areas often involves m ore than simply walking.\nAdventurers might have to climb,\
  \ crawl, swim, or jum p\nto get where they need to go.\nC l i m b i n g , S w i\
  \ m m i n g , a n d C r a w l i n g\nW hile climbing or swimming, each foot of movement\n\
  costs 1 extra foot (2 extra feet in difficult terrain), unless\na creature has a\
  \ climbing or swim m ing speed.\nAt the\nDM \u2019s option, clim bing a slippery\
  \ vertical surface or\none with few handholds requires a successful Strength\n(Athletics)\
  \ check.\nSimilarly, gaining any distance in\nrough water might require a successful\
  \ Strength\n(Athletics) check.\nJ u m p i n g\nYour Strength determines how far\
  \ you can jump.\nLong Jump.\nW hen you make a long jump, you cover a\nnumber of\
  \ feet up to your Strength score if you move at\nleast 10 feet on foot immediately\
  \ before the jump.\nW hen\nyou make a standing long jump, you can leap only half\n\
  that distance.\nEither way, each foot you clear on the\njum p costs a foot of movement.\n\
  This rule assum es that the height of your jum p\ndoesn\u2019t matter, such as a\
  \ jum p across a stream or\nchasm.\nAt your DM \u2019s option, you must succeed\
  \ on a\nDC 10 Strength (Athletics) check to clear a low obstacle\n(no taller than\
  \ a quarter of the jum p\u2019s distance), such as\na hedge or low wall.\nOtherwise,\
  \ you hit it.\nW hen you land in difficult terrain, you must succeed\non a DC 10\
  \ Dexterity (Acrobatics) check to land on your\nfeet.\nOtherwise, you land prone.\n\
  High Jump.\nW hen you make a high jump, you leap\ninto the air a num ber of feet\
  \ equal to 3 + your Strength\nm odifier if you move at least 10 feet on foot immediately\n\
  before the jump.\nW hen you make a standing high jump,\nyou can jum p only half\
  \ that distance.\nEither way, each\nfoot you clear on the jum p costs a foot o f\
  \ movement.\nIn\nsom e circum stances, your DM might allow you to make\na Strength\
  \ (Athletics) check to jum p higher than you\nnormally can.\nYou can extend your\
  \ arms half your height above\nyourself during the jump.\nThus, you can reach above\n\
  you a distance equal to the height of the jum p plus 1 1/2\ntimes your height.\n\
  A c t i v i t y W h i l e T r a v e l i n g\nAs adventurers travel through a dungeon\
  \ or the\nwilderness, they need to remain alert for danger, and\nsom e characters\
  \ might perform other tasks to help\nthe group\u2019s journey.\nM a r c h i n g\
  \ O r d e r\nThe adventurers should establish a m arching order.\nA m arching order\
  \ makes it easier to determine which\ncharacters are affected by traps, which ones\
  \ can spot\nhidden enemies, and which ones are the closest to those\nenem ies when\
  \ a fight breaks out.\nA character might occupy the front rank, one or m ore\nmiddle\
  \ ranks, or the back rank.\nCharacters in the front\nand back ranks need enough\
  \ room to travel side by\nside with others in their rank.\nW hen space is too tight,\n\
  the marching order must change, usually by moving\ncharacters to a middle rank.\n\
  Fewer Than Three Ranks.\nIf an adventuring party\narranges its marching order with\
  \ only two ranks, they\nare a front rank and a back rank.\nIf there\u2019s only\
  \ one rank,\nit\u2019s considered a front rank.\nSt e a l t h\nW hile traveling\
  \ at a slow pace, the characters can move\nstealthily.\nAs long as they\u2019re\
  \ not in the open, they can try\nto surprise or sneak by other creatures they encounter.\n\
  S ee the rules for hiding in chapter 7.\nN o t i c i n g T h r e a t s\nUse the\
  \ passive W isdom (Perception) scores of the\ncharacters to determine whether anyone\
  \ in the group\nnotices a hidden threat.\nThe DM might decide that a\nthreat can\
  \ be noticed only by characters in a particular\nrank.\nFor example, as the characters\
  \ are exploring a\nmaze o f tunnels, the DM might decide that only those\ncharacters\
  \ in the back rank have a chance to hear or\nspot a stealthy creature following\
  \ the group, while\ncharacters in the front and middle ranks cannot.\nW hile traveling\
  \ at a fast pace, characters take a - 5\npenalty to their passive W isdom (Perception)\
  \ scores\nto notice hidden threats.\nT r a v e l P a c e\nPace\nDistance Traveled\

  If the DM determines\nthat the adventurers encounter other creatures while\nthey\u2019\
  re traveling, it\u2019s up to both groups to decide what\nhappens next.\nEither\
  \ group might decide to attack,\ninitiate a conversation, run away, or wait to see\
  \ what the\nother group does.\nSurprising Foes.\nIf the adventurers encounter a\n\
  hostile creature or group, the DM determines whether\nthe adventurers or their foes\
  \ might be surprised when\ncom bat erupts.\nS ee chapter 9 for m ore about surprise.\n\
  O t h e r A c t i v i t i e s\nCharacters w ho turn their attention to other tasks\
  \ as the\ngroup travels are not focused on watching for danger.\nThese characters\
  \ don\u2019t contribute their passive W isdom\n(Perception) scores to the group\u2019\
  s chance of noticing\nhidden threats.\nHowever, a character not watching for\ndanger\
  \ can do one of the following activities instead, or\nsom e other activity with\
  \ the DM \u2019s permission.\nNavigate.\nThe character can try to prevent the group\n\
  from becom ing lost, making a W isdom (Survival) check\nwhen the DM calls for it.\
  \ (The Dungeon Master\u2019s Guide\nhas rules to determine whether the group gets\
  \ lost.)\nDraw a Map.\nThe character can draw a map\nthat records the group\u2019\
  s progress and helps the\ncharacters get back on course if they get lost.\nNo ability\n\
  check is required.\nTrack.\nA character can follow the tracks of another\ncreature,\
  \ making a W isdom (Survival) check when the\nDM calls for it. (The Dungeon Master\u2019\
  s Guide has rules\nfor tracking.)\nForage.\nThe character can keep an eye out for\
  \ ready\nsources of food and water, making a W isdom (Survival)\ncheck when the\
  \ DM calls for it. (The Dungeon Master\u2019s\nGuide has rules for foraging.)\n\
  T h e E n v i r o n m e n t\nBy its nature, adventuring involves delving into places\n\
  that are dark, dangerous, and full of mysteries to be\nexplored.\nThe rules in this\
  \ section cover som e of the\nmost important ways in w hich adventurers interact\
  \ with\nthe environment in such places.\nThe Dungeon Master\u2019s\nGuide has rules\
  \ covering m ore unusual situations.\nF a l l i n g\nA fall from a great height\
  \ is one of the most com m on\nhazards facing an adventurer.\nAt the end of a fall,\
  \ a creature takes 1d6 bludgeoning\ndamage for every 10 feet it fell, to a maximum\
  \ of 20d6.\nThe creature lands prone, unless it avoids taking\ndamage from the fall.\n\
  S u f f o c a t i n g\nA creature can hold its breath for a number of minutes\n\
  equal to 1 + its Constitution modifier (minimum\nof 30 seconds).\nW hen a creature\
  \ runs out of breath, it can survive for\na number o f rounds equal to its Constitution\
  \ modifier\n(minimum 1 round).\nAt the start of its next turn, it drops\nto 0 hit\
  \ points and is dying.\nS p l i t t i n g U p t h e Pa r t y\nSometimes, it makes\
  \ sense to split an adventuring party,\nespecially if you want one or more characters\
  \ to scout ahead.\nYou can form multiple parties, each moving at a different speed.\n\
  Each group has its own front, middle, and back ranks.\nThe drawback to this approach\
  \ is that the party will be split\ninto several smaller groups in the event of an\
  \ attack.\nThe\nadvantage is that a small group of stealthy characters moving\n\
  slowly might be able to sneak past enemies that clumsier\ncharacters would alert.\n\
  A rogue and a monk moving at a slow\npace are much harder to detect when they leave\
  \ their dwarf\npaladin friend behind.\nFor example, a creature with a Constitution\
  \ of 14 can\nhold its breath for 3 minutes.\nIf it starts suffocating, it\nhas 2\
  \ rounds to reach air before it drops to 0 hit points.\nV i s i o n a n d L i g\
  \ h t\nThe m ost fundamental tasks of adventuring\u2014noticing\ndanger, finding\
  \ hidden objects, hitting an enemy in\ncombat, and targeting a spell, to name just\
  \ a few\u2014\nrely heavily on a character\u2019s ability to see.\nDarkness\nand\
  \ other effects that obscure vision can prove a\nsignificant hindrance.\nA given\
  \ area might be lightly or heavily obscured.\nIn\na lightly obscured area, such\
  \ as dim light, patchy fog,\nor moderate foliage, creatures have disadvantage on\n\
  W isdom (Perception) checks that rely on sight.\nA heavily obscured area\u2014such\
  \ as darkness, opaque\nfog, or dense foliage\u2014blocks vision entirely.\nA creature\n\
  in a heavily obscured area effectively suffers from the\nblinded condition (see\
  \ appendix A).\nThe presence or absence of light in an environment\ncreates three\
  \ categories of illumination: bright light, dim\nlight, and darkness.\nBright light\
  \ lets most creatures see normally.\nEven\ngloom y days provide bright light, as\
  \ do torches, lanterns,\nfires, and other sources of illumination within a\nspecific\
  \ radius.\nDim light, also called shadows, creates a lightly\nobscured area.\nAn\
  \ area o f dim light is usually a\nboundary between a source of bright light, such\
  \ as\na torch, and surrounding darkness.\nThe soft light\nof twilight and dawn also\
  \ counts as dim light.\nA\nparticularly brilliant full m oon might bathe the land\n\
  in dim light.\nDarkness creates a heavily obscured area.\nCharacters\nface darkness\
  \ outdoors at night (even most moonlit\nnights), within the confines of an unlit\
  \ dungeon or a\nsubterranean vault, or in an area of m agical darkness.\nB l i n\
  \ d s i g h t\nA creature with blindsight can perceive its surroundings\nwithout\
  \ relying on sight, within a specific radius.\nCreatures without eyes, such as oozes,\
  \ and creatures\nwith echolocation or heightened senses, such as bats\nand true\
  \ dragons, have this sense.\nD a r k v i s i o n\nMany creatures in the w orlds\
  \ o f D&D, especially those\nthat dwell underground, have darkvision.\nWithin a\n\
  specified range, a creature with darkvision can see in\ndarkness as if the darkness\
  \ were dim light, so areas\nof darkness are only lightly obscured as far as that\n\
  creature is concerned.\nHowever, the creature can\u2019t\ndiscern color in darkness,\
  \ only shades of gray.\nT r u e s i g h t\nA creature with truesight can, out to\
  \ a specific range,\nsee in normal and magical darkness, see invisible\ncreatures\
  \ and objects, automatically detect visual\nillusions and succeed on saving throws\
  \ against them,\nand perceives the original form of a shapechanger or\na creature\
  \ that is transformed by magic.\nFurthermore,\nthe creature can see into the Ethereal\
  \ Plane.\nF o o d a n d W a t e r\nCharacters who don\u2019t eat or drink suffer\
  \ the effects of\nexhaustion (see appendix A).\nExhaustion caused by lack\nof food\
  \ or water can\u2019t be removed until the character\neats and drinks the full required\
  \ amount.\nF o o d\nA character needs one pound of food per day and can\nm ake food\
  \ last longer by subsisting on half rations.\nEating half a pound of food in a day\
  \ counts as half a day\nwithout food.\nA character can go without food for a number\
  \ of days\nequal to 3 + his or her Constitution modifier (minimum\n1).\nAt the end\
  \ o f each day beyond that limit, a character\nautomatically suffers one level of\
  \ exhaustion.\nA normal day of eating resets the count of days\nwithout food to\
  \ zero.\nW a t e r\nA character needs one gallon of water per day, or two\ngallons\
  \ per day if the weather is hot.\nA character who\ndrinks only half that much water\
  \ must succeed on a\nDC 15 Constitution saving throw or suffer one level of\nexhaustion\
  \ at the end of the day.\nA character with access\nto even less water automatically\
  \ suffers one level of\nexhaustion at the end o f the day.\nIf the character already\
  \ has one or m ore levels of\nexhaustion, the character takes two levels in either\
  \ case.\nI n t e r a c t i n g w i t h O b j e c t s\nA character\u2019s interaction\
  \ with objects in an environment\nis often simple to resolve in the game.\nThe player\
  \ tells\nthe DM that his or her character is doing something,\nsuch a moving a lever,\
  \ and the DM describes what, if\nanything happens.\nFor example, a character might\
  \ decide to pull a lever,\nwhich might, in turn, raise a portcullis, cause a room\
  \ to\nflood with water, or open a secret door in a nearby wall.\nIf the lever is\
  \ rusted in position, though, a character\nmight need to force it.\nIn such a situation,\
  \ the DM might\ncall for a Strength check to see whether the character\ncan wrench\
  \ the lever into place.\nThe DM sets the DC for\nany such check based on the difficulty\
  \ of the task.\nCharacters can also damage objects with their\nw eapons and spells.\n\
  Objects are immune to poison and\npsychic damage, but otherwise they can be affected\n\
  by physical and magical attacks much like creatures\ncan.\nThe DM determines an\
  \ object\u2019s Arm or Class and\nhit points, and might decide that certain objects\
  \ have\nresistance or immunity to certain kinds of attacks. (It\u2019s\nhard to\
  \ cut a rope with a club, for example.) Objects\nalways fail Strength and Dexterity\
  \ saving throws, and\nthey are immune to effects that require other saves.\nW hen\
  \ an object drops to 0 hit points, it breaks.\nA character can also attempt a Strength\
  \ check to\nbreak an object.\nThe DM sets the DC for any such check.\nSo c i a l\
  \ In t e r a c t io n\nExploring dungeons, overcom ing obstacles, and slaying\n\
  m onsters are key parts of D&D adventures.\nNo less\nimportant, though, are the\
  \ social interactions that\nadventurers have with other inhabitants of the world.\n\
  Interaction takes on many forms.\nYou might need\nto convince an unscrupulous thief\
  \ to confess to som e\nm alfeasance, or you might try to flatter a dragon so that\n\
  it will spare your life.\nThe DM assum es the roles of any\ncharacters w ho are\
  \ participating in the interaction that\ndon\u2019t belong to another player at\
  \ the table.\nAny such\ncharacter is called a nonplayer character (NPC).\nIn general\
  \ terms, an N PC \u2019s attitude toward you is\ndescribed as friendly, indifferent,\
  \ or hostile.\nFriendly\nNPCs are predisposed to help you, and hostile ones are\n\
  inclined to get in your way.\nIt\u2019s easier to get what you\nwant from a friendly\
  \ NPC, o f course.\nSocial interactions have two primary aspects:\nroleplaying and\
  \ ability checks.\nR o l e p l a y i n g\nRoleplaying is, literally, the act of\
  \ playing out a role.\nIn this case, it\u2019s you as a player determining how your\n\
  character thinks, acts, and talks.\nRoleplaying is a part of every aspect o f the\
  \ game,\nand it com es to the fore during social interactions.\nYour character\u2019\
  s quirks, mannerisms, and personality\ninfluence how interactions resolve.\nThere\
  \ are two styles you can use when roleplaying\nyour character: the descriptive approach\
  \ and the active\napproach.\nMost players use a combination of the two\nstyles.\n\
  Use whichever m ix of the two works best for you.\nD e s c r i p t i v e A p p r\
  \ o a c h t o R o l e p l a y i n g\nW ith this approach, you describe your character\u2019\
  s w ords\nand actions to the DM and the other players.\nDrawing on\nyour mental\
  \ image of your character, you tell everyone\nwhat your character does and how he\
  \ or she does it.\nFor instance, Chris plays Tordek the dwarf.\nTordek\nhas a quick\
  \ temper and blam es the elves of the\nCloakwood for his family\u2019s misfortune.\n\
  At a tavern, an\nobnoxious elf minstrel sits at Tordek\u2019s table and tries to\n\
  strike up a conversation with the dwarf.\nChris says, \u201CTordek spits on the\
  \ floor, growls an\ninsult at the bard, and stomps over to the bar.\nHe sits\non\
  \ a stool and glares at the minstrel before ordering\nanother drink.\u201D\nIn this\
  \ example, Chris has conveyed Tordek\u2019s m ood\nand given the DM a clear idea\
  \ of his character\u2019s\nattitude and actions.\nW hen using descriptive roleplaying,\
  \ keep the\nfollowing things in mind:\n\u2022 D escribe your character\u2019s em\
  \ otions and attitude.\n\u2022 Focus on your character\u2019s intent and how others\n\
  might perceive it.\n\u2022 Provide as much embellishment as you feel\ncom fortable\
  \ with.\nD on\u2019t w orry about getting things exactly right.\nJust\nfocus on\
  \ thinking about what your character would do\nand describing what you see in your\
  \ mind.\nA c t i v e A p p r o a c h t o R o l e p l a y i n g\nIf descriptive roleplaying\
  \ tells your DM and your fellow\nplayers what your character thinks and does, active\n\
  roleplaying shows them.\nW hen you use active roleplaying, you speak with your\n\
  character\u2019s voice, like an actor taking on a role.\nYou might\neven echo your\
  \ character\u2019s movements and body language.\nThis approach is m ore im mersive\
  \ than descriptive\nroleplaying, though you still need to describe things\nthat\
  \ can\u2019t be reasonably acted out.\nGoing back to the example of Chris roleplaying\
  \ Tordek\nabove, here\u2019s how the scene might play out if Chris used\nactive\
  \ roleplaying:\nSpeaking as Tordek, Chris says in a gruff, deep voice,\n\u201CI\
  \ was w ondering why it suddenly sm elled awful in here.\nIf I wanted to hear anything\
  \ out o f you, I'd snap your\narm and enjoy your scream s.\u201D In his normal voice,\
  \ Chris\nthen adds, \u201CI get up, glare at the elf, and head to the bar.\u201D\
  \nR e s u l t s o f R o l e p l a y i n g\nThe DM uses your character\u2019s actions\
  \ and attitudes to\ndetermine how an NPC reacts.\nA cowardly NPC buckles\nunder\
  \ threats of violence.\nA stubborn dwarf refuses to\nlet anyone badger her.\nA vain\
  \ dragon laps up flattery.\nW hen interacting with an NPC, pay close attention to\n\
  the DM \u2019s portrayal o f the N PC \u2019s m ood, dialogue, and\npersonality.\n\
  You might be able to determine an N PC \u2019s\npersonality traits, ideals, flaws,\
  \ and bonds, then play on\nthem to influence the N PC \u2019s attitude.\nInteractions\
  \ in D&D are much like interactions in\nreal life.\nIf you can offer N PCs som ething\
  \ they want,\nthreaten them with som ething they fear, or play on their\nsympathies\
  \ and goals, you can use words to get almost\nanything you want.\nOn the other hand,\
  \ if you insult a\nproud w arrior or speak ill of a noble\u2019s allies, your efforts\n\
  to convince or deceive will fall short.\nA b i l i t y C h e c k s\nIn addition\
  \ to roleplaying, ability checks are key in\ndetermining the outcom e of an interaction.\n\
  Your roleplaying efforts can alter an N PC\u2019s attitude,\nbut there might still\
  \ be an element of chance in the\nsituation.\nFor example, your DM can call for\
  \ a Charisma\ncheck at any point during an interaction if he or she\nwants the dice\
  \ to play a role in determining an N PC \u2019s\nreactions.\nOther checks might\
  \ be appropriate in certain\nsituations, at your DM \u2019s discretion.\nPay attention\
  \ to your skill proficiencies when thinking\nof how you want to interact with an\
  \ NPC, and stack\nthe deck in your favor by using an approach that relies\non your\
  \ best bonuses and skills.\nIf the group needs to\ntrick a guard into letting them\
  \ into a castle, the rogue\nw ho is proficient in Deception is the best bet to lead\
  \ the\ndiscussion.\nW hen negotiating for a hostage\u2019s release,\nthe cleric\
  \ with Persuasion should do most of the talking.\nR e s t in g\nH eroic though they\
  \ might be, adventurers can\u2019t spend\nevery hour o f the day in the thick of\
  \ exploration, social\ninteraction, and combat.\nThey need rest\u2014time to\nsleep\
  \ and eat, tend their wounds, refresh their minds\nand spirits for spellcasting,\
  \ and brace themselves for\nfurther adventure.\nAdventurers can take short rests\
  \ in the midst of an\nadventuring day and a long rest to end the day.\nS h o r t\
  \ R e s t\nA short rest is a period of downtime, at least 1 hour long,\nduring which\
  \ a character does nothing m ore strenuous\nthan eating, drinking, reading, and\
  \ tending to wounds.\nA character can spend one or m ore Hit Dice at the end\nof\
  \ a short rest, up to the character\u2019s maximum number\nof Hit Dice, which is\
  \ equal to the character's level.\nFor\neach Hit Die spent in this way, the player\
  \ rolls the die\nand adds the character\u2019s Constitution modifier to it.\nThe\n\
  character regains hit points equal to the total.\nThe player\ncan decide to spend\
  \ an additional Hit Die after each roll.\nA character regains som e spent Hit Dice\
  \ upon finishing\na long rest, as explained below.\nL o n g R e s t\nA long rest\
  \ is a period of extended downtime, at least 8\nhours long, during which a character\
  \ sleeps or perform s\nlight activity: reading, talking, eating, or standing watch\n\
  for no m ore than 2 hours.\nIf the rest is interrupted by a\nperiod of strenuous\
  \ activity\u2014at least 1 hour of walking,\nfighting, casting spells, or similar\
  \ adventuring activity\u2014\nthe characters must begin the rest again to gain any\n\
  benefit from it.\nAt the end of a long rest, a character regains all lost\nhit points.\n\
  The character also regains spent Hit Dice, up\nto a number of dice equal to half\
  \ of the character\u2019s total\nnumber of them.\nFor example, if a character has\
  \ eight\nHit Dice, he or she can regain four spent Hit Dice upon\nfinishing a long\
  \ rest.\nA character can\u2019t benefit from m ore than one long rest\nin a 24-hour\
  \ period, and a character must have at least\n1 hit point at the start of the rest\
  \ to gain its benefits.\nB e t w e e n A d v e n t u r e s\nBetween trips to dungeons\
  \ and battles against ancient\nevils, adventurers need time to rest, recuperate,\
  \ and\nprepare for their next adventure.\nMany adventurers also\nuse this time to\
  \ perform other tasks, such as crafting\narms and armor, perform ing research, or\
  \ spending\ntheir hard-earned gold.\nIn som e cases, the passage o f time is som\
  \ ething that\noccurs with little fanfare or description.\nW hen starting\na new\
  \ adventure, the DM might simply declare that a\ncertain amount of time has passed\
  \ and allow you to\ndescribe in general terms what your character has\nbeen doing.\n\
  At other times, the DM might want to keep\ntrack of just how much time is passing\
  \ as events beyond\nyour perception stay in motion.\nL i f e s t y l e E x p e n\
  \ s e s\nBetween adventures, you choose a particular quality\nof life and pay the\
  \ cost of maintaining that lifestyle, as\ndescribed in chapter 5.\nLiving a particular\
  \ lifestyle doesn\u2019t have a huge effect\non your character, but your lifestyle\
  \ can affect the way\nother individuals and groups react to you.\nFor example,\n\
  when you lead an aristocratic lifestyle, it might be easier\nfor you to influence\
  \ the nobles of the city than if you\nlive in poverty.\nD o w n t i m e A c t i\
  \ v i t i e s\nBetween adventures, the DM might ask you what your\ncharacter is\
  \ doing during his or her downtime.\nPeriods\nof downtime can vary in duration,\
  \ but each downtime\nactivity requires a certain number of days to complete\nbefore\
  \ you gain any benefit, and at least 8 hours of each\nday must be spent on the downtime\
  \ activity for the day\nto count.\nThe days do not need to be consecutive.\nIf you\n\
  have m ore than the minim um amount of days to spend,\nyou can keep doing the same\
  \ thing for a longer period\nof time, or switch to a new downtime activity.\nDowntim\
  \ e activities other than the ones presented\nbelow are possible.\nIf you want your\
  \ character to spend\nhis or her downtime perform ing an activity not covered\n\
  here, discuss it with your DM.\nC r a f t i n g\nYou can craft nonm agical objects,\
  \ including adventuring\nequipment and w orks of art.\nYou must be proficient\n\
  with tools related to the object you are trying to create\n(typically artisan\u2019\
  s tools).\nYou might also need access to\nspecial materials or locations necessary\
  \ to create it.\nFor\nexample, som eone proficient with smith\u2019s tools needs\
  \ a\nforge in order to craft a sword or suit of armor.\nFor every day of downtime\
  \ you spend crafting, you\ncan craft one or m ore items with a total market value\n\
  not exceeding 5 gp, and you must expend raw materials\nworth half the total market\
  \ value.\nIf som ething you\nwant to craft has a market value greater than 5 gp,\
  \ you\nmake progress every day in 5-gp increments until you\nreach the market value\
  \ of the item.\nFor example, a suit\nof plate arm or (market value 1,500 gp) takes\
  \ 300 days\nto craft by yourself.\nMultiple characters can com bine their efforts\
  \ toward\nthe crafting of a single item, provided that the characters\nall have\
  \ proficiency with the requisite tools and are\nworking together in the same place.\n\
  Each character\ncontributes 5 gp worth of effort for every day spent\nhelping to\
  \ craft the item.\nFor example, three characters\nwith the requisite tool proficiency\
  \ and the proper\nfacilities can craft a suit o f plate armor in 100 days,\nat a\
  \ total cost o f 750 gp.\nW hile crafting, you can maintain a m odest lifestyle\n\
  without having to pay 1 gp per day, or a comfortable\nlifestyle at half the normal\
  \ cost (see chapter 5 for more\ninformation on lifestyle expenses).\nP r a c t i\
  \ c i n g a P r o f e s s i o n\nYou can work between adventures, allowing you to\n\
  maintain a modest lifestyle without having to pay 1 gp\nper day (see chapter 5 for\
  \ more information on lifestyle\nexpenses).\nThis benefit lasts as long you continue\
  \ to\npractice your profession.\nIf you are a m em ber of an organization that can\n\
  provide gainful employment, such as a temple or a\nthieves\u2019 guild, you earn\
  \ enough to support a com fortable\nlifestyle instead.\nIf you have proficiency\
  \ in the Perform ance skill and\nput your perform ance skill to use during your\
  \ downtime,\nyou earn enough to support a wealthy lifestyle instead.\nR e c u p\
  \ e r a t i n g\nYou can use downtime between adventures to recover\nfrom a debilitating\
  \ injury, disease, or poison.\nAfter three days of downtime spent recuperating,\n\
  you can make a DC 15 Constitution saving throw.\nOn a successful save, you can choose\
  \ one of the\nfollowing results:\n\u2022 End one effect on you that prevents you\
  \ from regain\xAD\ning hit points.\n\u2022 For the next 24 hours, gain advantage\
  \ on saving\nthrows against one disease or poison currently\naffecting you.\nR e\
  \ s e a r c h i n g\nThe time between adventures is a great chance to\nperform research,\
  \ gaining insight into mysteries\nthat have unfurled over the course o f the campaign.\n\
  Research can include poring over dusty tom es and\ncrumbling scrolls in a library\
  \ or buying drinks for the\nlocals to pry rum ors and gossip from their lips.\n\
  W hen you begin your research, the DM determines\nwhether the information is available,\
  \ how many days of\ndowntime it will take to find it, and whether there are\nany\
  \ restrictions on your research (such as needing to\nseek out a specific individual,\
  \ tome, or location).\nThe\nDM might also require you to make one or m ore ability\n\
  checks, such as an Intelligence (Investigation) check\nto find clues pointing toward\
  \ the information you seek,\nor a Charisma (Persuasion) check to secure som eone\u2019\
  s\naid.\nOnce those conditions are met, you learn the\ninformation if it is available.\n\
  For each day of research, you must spend 1 gp to\ncover your expenses.\nThis cost\
  \ is in addition to your\nnormal lifestyle expenses (as discussed in chapter 5).\n\
  T r a i n i n g\nYou can spend time between adventures learning a new\nlanguage\
  \ or training with a set of tools.\nYour DM might\nallow additional training options.\n\
  First, you must find an instructor willing to teach you.\nThe DM determines how\
  \ long it takes, and whether one\nor m ore ability checks are required.\nThe training\
  \ lasts for 250 days and costs 1 gp per day.\nAfter you spend the requisite amount\
  \ of time and money,\nyou learn the new language or gain proficiency with\nthe new\
  \ tool.\nC h a p t e r 9: C o m b a t\nTHE CLATTER OF A SWORD STRIKING AGAINST\n\
  a shield.\nThe terrible rending sound as\nm onstrous claws tear through armor.\n\
  A\nbrilliant flash of light as a ball of flame\nblossom s from a w izard\u2019s\
  \ spell.\nThe sharp\ntang of blood in the air, cutting through\nthe stench of vile\
  \ monsters.\nRoars of fury,\nshouts of triumph, cries of pain.\nCombat in D&D can\
  \ be\nchaotic, deadly, and thrilling.\nThis chapter provides the rules you need\
  \ for your\ncharacters and m onsters to engage in combat, whether\nit is a brief\
  \ skirm ish or an extended conflict in a\ndungeon or on a field o f battle.\nThroughout\
  \ this chapter,\nthe rules address you, the player or Dungeon Master.\nThe Dungeon\
  \ Master controls all the monsters and\nnonplayer characters involved in combat,\
  \ and each other\nplayer controls an adventurer. \u201CYou\u201D can also mean the\n\
  character or monster that you control.\nT h e O rder of C o m b a t\nA typical com\
  \ bat encounter is a clash between two\nsides, a flurry of w eapon swings, feints,\
  \ parries,\nfootwork, and spellcasting.\nThe game organizes the\nchaos of combat\
  \ into a cycle of rounds and turns.\nA\nround represents about 6 seconds in the\
  \ game world.\nDuring a round, each participant in a battle takes a\nturn.\nThe\
  \ order of turns is determined at the beginning\nof a com bat encounter, when everyone\
  \ rolls initiative.\nOnce everyone has taken a turn, the fight continues to\nthe\
  \ next round if neither side has defeated the other.\nS u r p r i s e\nA band of\
  \ adventurers sneaks up on a bandit camp,\nspringing from the trees to attack them.\n\
  A gelatinous\ncube glides down a dungeon passage, unnoticed by\nthe adventurers\
  \ until the cube engulfs one of them.\nIn\nthese situations, one side of the battle\
  \ gains surprise\nover the other.\nThe DM determines w ho might be surprised.\n\
  If\nneither side tries to be stealthy, they automatically notice\neach other.\n\
  Otherwise, the DM com pares the Dexterity\n(Stealth) checks of anyone hiding with\
  \ the passive\nW isdom (Perception) score of each creature on the\nC o m b a t S\
  \ t e p b y S t e p\n1.\nDetermine surprise.\nThe DM determines whether anyone\n\
  involved in the combat encounter is surprised.\n2.\nEstablish positions.\nThe DM\
  \ decides where all the\ncharacters and monsters are located.\nGiven the\nadventurers\u2019\
  \ marching order or their stated positions in\nthe room or other location, the DM\
  \ figures out where the\nadversaries are\u2014 how far away and in what direction.\n\
  3.\nRoll initiative.\nEveryone involved in the combat encounter\nrolls initiative,\
  \ determining the order of combatants\u2019 turns.\n4.\nTake turns.\nEach participant\
  \ in the battle takes a turn in\ninitiative order.\n5.\nBegin the next round.\n\
  When everyone involved in the\ncombat has had a turn, the round ends.\nRepeat step\
  \ 4 until\nthe fighting stops.\nopposing side.\nAny character or monster that doesn\u2019\
  t\nnotice a threat is surprised at the start of the encounter.\nIf you\u2019re surprised,\
  \ you can\u2019t move or take an action\non your first turn of the combat, and you\
  \ can\u2019t take a\nreaction until that turn ends.\nA m em ber of a group can\n\
  be surprised even if the other m em bers aren\u2019t.\nI n i t i a t i v e\nInitiative\
  \ determines the order of turns during combat.\nW hen combat starts, every participant\
  \ makes a\nDexterity check to determine their place in the initiative\norder.\n\
  The DM makes one roll for an entire group of\nidentical creatures, so each m em\
  \ ber of the group acts at\nthe same time.\nThe DM ranks the combatants in order\
  \ from the one\nwith the highest Dexterity check total to the one with\nthe lowest.\n\
  This is the order (called the initiative order)\nin which they act during each round.\n\
  The initiative order\nremains the same from round to round.\nIf a tie occurs, the\
  \ DM decides the order among\ntied DM-controlled creatures, and the players decide\n\
  the order am ong their tied characters.\nThe DM can\ndecide the order if the tie\
  \ is between a monster and a\nplayer character.\nOptionally, the DM can have the\
  \ tied\ncharacters and monsters each roll a d20 to determine\nthe order, highest\
  \ roll going first.\nY o u r T u r n\nOn your turn, you can move a distance up to\
  \ your speed\nand take one action.\nYou decide whether to move first\nor take your\
  \ action first.\nYour speed\u2014som etim es called\nyour walking speed\u2014is\
  \ noted on your character sheet.\nThe most com m on actions you can take are described\n\
  in the \u201CActions in Com bat\u201D section later in this chapter.\nMany class\
  \ features and other abilities provide\nadditional options for your action.\nThe\
  \ \u201CMovement and Position\u201D section later in this\nchapter gives the rules\
  \ for your move.\nYou can forgo moving, taking an action, or doing\nanything at\
  \ all on your turn.\nIf you can\u2019t decide what to\ndo on your turn, consider\
  \ taking the Dodge or Ready\naction, as described in \u201CActions in Combat.\u201D\
  \nB o n u s A c t i o n s\nVarious class features, spells, and other abilities let\
  \ you\ntake an additional action on your turn called a bonus\naction.\nThe Cunning\
  \ Action feature, for example, allows\na rogue to take a bonus action.\nYou can\
  \ take a bonus\naction only when a special ability, spell, or other feature\nof\
  \ the game states that you can do som ething as a bonus\naction.\nYou otherwise\
  \ don\u2019t have a bonus action to take.\nYou can take only one bonus action on\
  \ your turn, so\nyou must choose which bonus action to use w hen you\nhave m ore\
  \ than one available.\nYou choose when to take a bonus action during your\nturn,\
  \ unless the bonus action\u2019s timing is specified, and\nanything that deprives\
  \ you of your ability to take actions\nalso prevents you from taking a bonus action.\n\
  O t h e r A c t i v i t y o n Y o u r T u r n\nYour turn can include a variety of\
  \ flourishes that require\nneither your action nor your move.\nYou can com m unicate\
  \ however you are able, through\nbrief utterances and gestures, as you take your\
  \ turn.\nYou can also interact with one object or feature of the\nenvironment for\
  \ free, during either your move or your\naction.\nFor example, you could open a\
  \ door during your\nmove as you stride toward a foe, or you could draw your\nweapon\
  \ as part of the sam e action you use to attack.\nIf you want to interact with a\
  \ second object, you need\nto use your action.\nS om e magic items and other special\n\
  objects always require an action to use, as stated\nin their descriptions.\nThe\
  \ DM might require you to use an action for any\nof these activities w hen it needs\
  \ special care or when it\npresents an unusual obstacle.\nFor instance, the DM\n\
  could reasonably expect you to use an action to open a\nstuck door or turn a crank\
  \ to lower a drawbridge.\nR e a c t i o n s\nCertain special abilities, spells,\
  \ and situations allow\nyou to take a special action called a reaction.\nA reaction\n\
  is an instant response to a trigger of som e kind, which\ncan occur on your turn\
  \ or on som eone else\u2019s.\nThe\nopportunity attack, described later in this\
  \ chapter, is the\nmost com m on type of reaction.\nW hen you take a reaction, you\
  \ can\u2019t take another one\nuntil the start of your next turn.\nIf the reaction\
  \ interrupts\nanother creature\u2019s turn, that creature can continue its\nturn\
  \ right after the reaction.\nM o v e m e n t a n d Po s it io n\nIn combat, characters\
  \ and m onsters are in constant\nmotion, often using movement and position to gain\n\
  the upper hand.\nI n t e r a c t i n g w i t h O b j e c t s A r o u n d Y o u\n\
  Here are a few examples of the sorts of thing you can do in\ntandem with your movement\
  \ and action:\n\u2022 draw or sheathe a sword\n\u2022 open or close a door\n\u2022\
  \ withdraw a potion from your backpack\n\u2022 pick up a dropped axe\n\u2022 take\
  \ a bauble from a table\n\u2022 remove a ring from your finger\n\u2022 stuff some\
  \ food into your mouth\n\u2022 plant a banner in the ground\n\u2022 fish a few coins\
  \ from your belt pouch\n\u2022 drink all the ale in a flagon\n\u2022 throw a lever\
  \ or a switch\n\u2022 pull a torch from a sconce\n\u2022 take a book from a shelf\
  \ you can reach\n\u2022 extinguish a small flame\n\u2022 don a mask\n\u2022 pull\
  \ the hood of your cloak up and over your head\n\u2022 put your ear to a door\n\u2022\
  \ kick a small stone\n\u2022 turn a key in a lock\n\u2022 tap the floor with a 10-foot\
  \ pole\n\u2022 hand an item to another character\nOn your turn, you can move a distance\
  \ up to your\nspeed.\nYou can use as much or as little of your speed as\nyou like\
  \ on your turn, following the rules here.\nYour movement can include jumping, climbing,\
  \ and\nswimming.\nThese different m odes of movement can\nbe com bined with walking,\
  \ or they can constitute your\nentire move.\nHowever you\u2019re moving, you deduct\
  \ the\ndistance of each part of your move from your speed until\nit is used up or\
  \ until you are done moving.\nThe \u201CSpecial Types of Movement\u2019\u2019 section\
  \ in\nchapter 8 gives the particulars for jumping, climbing,\nand swimming.\nB r\
  \ e a k i n g U p Y o u r M o v e\nYou can break up your movement on your turn,\
  \ using\nsom e of your speed before and after your action.\nFor\nexample, if you\
  \ have a speed of 30 feet, you can move\n10 feet, take your action, and then move\
  \ 20 feet.\nM o v i n g b e t w e e n A t t a c k s\nIf you take an action that\
  \ includes m ore than one\nweapon attack, you can break up your movement even\n\
  further by moving between those attacks.\nFor example,\na fighter w ho can make\
  \ two attacks with the Extra\nAttack feature and who has a speed of 25 feet could\n\
  move 10 feet, make an attack, move 15 feet, and then\nattack again.\nU s in g D\
  \ i f f e r e n t S p e e d s\nIf you have m ore than one speed, such as your walking\n\
  speed and a flying speed, you can switch back and forth\nbetween your speeds during\
  \ your move.\nW henever you\nswitch, subtract the distance you've already m oved\
  \ from\nthe new speed.\nThe result determines how much farther\nyou can move.\n\
  If the result is 0 or less, you can\u2019t use the\nnew speed during the current\
  \ move.\nFor example, if you have a speed of 30 and a flying\nspeed of 60 because\
  \ a wizard cast the fly spell on you,\nyou could fly 20 feet, then walk 10 feet,\
  \ and then leap\ninto the air to fly 30 feet more.\nD i f f i c u l t T e r r a\

  \ caverns, briar-\nchoked forests, treacherous staircases\u2014the setting of\n\
  a typical fight contains difficult terrain.\nEvery foot of movement in difficult\
  \ terrain costs 1\nextra foot.\nThis rule is true even if multiple things in\na\
  \ space count as difficult terrain.\nLow furniture, rubble, undergrowth, steep stairs,\n\
  snow, and shallow bogs are examples o f difficult terrain.\nThe space of another\
  \ creature, whether hostile or not,\nalso counts as difficult terrain.\nB e i n\
  \ g P r o n e\nCombatants often find themselves lying on the ground,\neither because\
  \ they are knocked down or because they\nthrow themselves down.\nIn the game, they\
  \ are prone,\na condition described in appendix A.\nYou can drop prone without using\
  \ any of your\nspeed.\nStanding up takes m ore effort; doing so costs\nan amount\
  \ of movement equal to half your speed.\nFor\nexample, if your speed is 30 feet,\
  \ you must spend 15 feet\nof movement to stand up.\nYou can\u2019t stand up if you\
  \ don\u2019t\nhave enough movement left or if your speed is 0.\nTo move while prone,\
  \ you must crawl or use magic\nsuch as teleportation.\nEvery foot of movement while\n\
  crawling costs 1 extra foot.\nCrawling 1 foot in difficult\nterrain, therefore,\
  \ costs 3 feet of movement.\nM o v i n g A r o u n d O t h e r\nC r e a t u r e\
  \ s\nYou can move through a nonhostile creature\u2019s space.\nIn contrast, you\
  \ can move through a hostile creature's\nspace only if the creature is at least\
  \ two sizes larger or\nsmaller than you.\nRem em ber that another creature\u2019\
  s\nspace is difficult terrain for you.\nW hether a creature is a friend or an enemy,\
  \ you can\u2019t\nwillingly end your move in its space.\nIf you leave a hostile\
  \ creature\u2019s reach during your\nmove, you provoke an opportunity attack, as\
  \ explained\nlater in the chapter.\nF l y i n g M o v e m e n t\nFlying creatures\
  \ enjoy many benefits of mobility, but\nthey must also deal with the danger of falling.\n\
  If a flying\ncreature is knocked prone, has its speed reduced to 0, or\nis otherwise\
  \ deprived of the ability to move, the creature\nfalls, unless it has the ability\
  \ to hover or it is being held\naloft by magic, such as by the fly spell.\nC r e\

  Gargantuan\n20 by 20 ft. or larger\nS p a c e\nA creature's space is the area in\
  \ feet that it effectively\ncontrols in combat, not an expression of its physical\n\
  dim ensions.\nA typical M edium creature isn't 5 feet\nwide, for example, but it\
  \ does control a space that\nwide.\nIf a M edium hobgoblin stands in a 5-foot-wide\n\
  doorway, other creatures can\u2019t get through unless the\nhobgoblin lets them.\n\
  A creature\u2019s space also reflects the area it needs to\nfight effectively.\n\
  For that reason, there\u2019s a limit to the\nnumber of creatures that can surround\
  \ another creature\nin combat.\nAssum ing Medium combatants, eight\ncreatures can\
  \ fit in a 5-foot radius around another one.\nBecause larger creatures take up m\
  \ ore space, fewer\no f them can surround a creature.\nIf five Large creatures\n\

  \ grid and miniatures\nor other tokens, follow these rules.\nSquares.\nEach square\
  \ on the grid represents 5 feet.\nSpeed.\nRather than moving foot by foot, move\
  \ square by\nsquare on the grid.\nThis means you use your speed in 5-foot\nsegments.\n\
  This is particularly easy if you translate your speed\ninto squares by dividing\
  \ the speed by 5.\nFor example, a speed\nof 30 feet translates into a speed of 6\
  \ squares.\nIf you use a grid often, consider writing your speed in\nsquares on\
  \ your character sheet.\nEntering a Square.\nTo enter a square, you must have\n\
  at least 1 square of movement left, even if the square is\ndiagonally adjacent to\
  \ the square you\u2019re in. (The rule for\ndiagonal movement sacrifices realism\
  \ for the sake of smooth\nplay.\nThe Dungeon M aster\u2019s Guide provides guidance\
  \ on using\na more realistic approach.)\nIf a square costs extra movement, as a\
  \ square of difficult\nterrain does, you must have enough movement left to pay for\n\
  entering it.\nFor example, you must have at least 2 squares of\nmovement left to\
  \ enter a square of difficult terrain.\nCorners.\nDiagonal movement can\u2019t cross\
  \ the corner of a\nwall, large tree, or other terrain feature that fills its space.\n\
  Ranges.\nTo determine the range on a grid between two\nthings\u2014 whether creatures\
  \ or objects\u2014 start counting squares\nfrom a square adjacent to one of them\
  \ and stop counting in\nthe space of the other one.\nCount by the shortest route.\n\

  \ a space that is large\nenough for a creature one size smaller than it.\nThus,\
  \ a\nLarge creature can squeeze through a passage that's\nonly 5 feet wide.\nW hile\
  \ squeezing through a space,\na creature must spend 1 extra foot for every foot\
  \ it\nmoves there, and it has disadvantage on attack rolls\nand Dexterity saving\

  \ your turn, you can take\none of the actions presented here, an action you gained\n\
  from your class or a special feature, or an action that\nyou improvise.\nMany monsters\
  \ have action options of\ntheir own in their stat blocks.\nW hen you describe an\

  \ is\npossible and what kind o f roll you need to make, if any,\nto determine success\
  \ or failure.\nA t t a c k\nThe most com m on action to take in combat is the Attack\n\
  action, whether you are swinging a sword, firing an\narrow from a bow, or brawling\
  \ with your fists.\nWith this action, you make one melee or ranged\nattack.\nSee\
  \ the \u201CMaking an Attack\u201D section for the rules\nthat govern attacks.\n\
  Certain features, such as the Extra Attack feature\nof the fighter, allow you to\
  \ make m ore than one attack\nwith this action.\nC a s t a S p e l l\nSpellcasters\
  \ such as w izards and clerics, as well as\nmany monsters, have access to spells\
  \ and can use\nthem to great effect in combat.\nEach spell has a casting\ntime,\
  \ which specifies whether the caster must use an\naction, a reaction, minutes, or\
  \ even hours to cast the\nspell.\nCasting a spell is, therefore, not necessarily\
  \ an\naction.\nMost spells do have a casting time of 1 action,\nso a spellcaster\
  \ often uses his or her action in combat\nto cast such a spell.\nSee chapter 10\
  \ for the rules\non spellcasting.\nD a s h\nW hen you take the Dash action, you\
  \ gain extra\nmovement for the current turn.\nThe increase equals\nyour speed, after\
  \ applying any modifiers.\nWith a speed\nof 30 feet, for example, you can move up\
  \ to 60 feet on your\nturn if you dash.\nAny increase or decrease to your speed\
  \ changes this\nadditional movement by the same amount.\nIf your speed\nof 30 feet\
  \ is reduced to 15 feet, for instance, you can\nmove up to 30 feet this turn if\
  \ you dash.\nD i s\ne\nn\ng\na\ng\ne\nIf you take the Disengage action, your movement\

  W hen you take the Dodge action, you focus entirely on\navoiding attacks.\nUntil\
  \ the start of your next turn, any\nattack roll made against you has disadvantage\
  \ if you\ncan see the attacker, and you make Dexterity saving\nthrows with advantage.\n\
  You lose this benefit if you are\nincapacitated (as explained in appendix A) or\
  \ if your\nspeed drops to 0.\nH e l p\nYou can lend your aid to another creature\
  \ in the\ncompletion of a task.\nW hen you take the Help action,\nthe creature you\
  \ aid gains advantage on the next ability\ncheck it makes to perform the task you\
  \ are helping with,\nprovided that it makes the check before the start of\nyour\
  \ next turn.\nAlternatively, you can aid a friendly creature in\nattacking a creature\
  \ within 5 feet of you.\nYou feint,\ndistract the target, or in som e other way\
  \ team up to\nmake your ally\u2019s attack m ore effective.\nIf your ally\nattacks\

  \ n O b j e c t\nYou normally interact with an object while doing\nsom ething else,\
  \ such as when you draw a sword as part\nof an attack.\nW hen an object requires\

  \ also useful when you want to interact with m ore than\none object on your turn.\n\
  W hether you\u2019re striking with a melee weapon, firing a\nw eapon at range, or\
  \ making an attack roll as part of a\nspell, an attack has a simple structure.\n\
  Som etim es you want to get the jum p on a foe or wait for\na particular circum\
  \ stance before you act.\nTo do so, you\ncan take the Ready action on your turn\
  \ so that you can\nact later in the round using your reaction.\nFirst, you decide\
  \ what perceivable circum stance\nwill trigger your reaction.\nThen, you choose\
  \ the action\nyou will take in response to that trigger, or you choose\nto move\
  \ up to your speed in response to it.\nExamples\ninclude \u201CIf the cultist steps\
  \ on the trapdoor, I\u2019ll pull the\nlever that opens it,\u201D and \u201CIf the\
  \ goblin steps next to me,\nI move away.\u201D\nW hen the trigger occurs, you can\
  \ either take your\nreaction right after the trigger finishes or ignore\nthe trigger.\n\
  Rem em ber that you can take only one\nreaction per round.\nW hen you ready a spell,\
  \ you cast it as normal but\nhold its energy, which you release with your reaction\n\
  when the trigger occurs.\nTo be readied, a spell must\nhave a casting time of 1\
  \ action, and holding onto the\nspell\u2019s magic requires concentration (explained\
  \ in\nchapter 10).\nIf your concentration is broken, the spell\ndissipates without\
  \ taking effect.\nFor example, if you are\nconcentrating on the web spell and ready\
  \ magic missile,\nyour web spell ends, and if you take damage before\nyou release\
  \ magic missile with your reaction, your\nconcentration might be broken.\nA t t\
  \ a c k R o l l s\nW hen you make an attack, your attack roll determines\nwhether\

  \ is\nprovided in its stat block.\nAbility Modifier.\nThe ability modifier used\
  \ for a melee\nweapon attack is Strength, and the ability modifier used\nfor a ranged\
  \ weapon attack is Dexterity.\nW eapons that\nhave the finesse or thrown property\

  s ever any question whether som ething you\u2019re\ndoing counts as an attack, the\
  \ rule is simple: if you\u2019re\nmaking an attack roll, you\u2019re making an attack.\n\
  Combatants often try to escape their foes\u2019 notice\nby hiding, casting the invisibility\

  \ a c k s\nUsed in hand-to-hand combat, a melee attack allows\nyou to attack a foe\
  \ within your reach.\nA melee attack\ntypically uses a handheld weapon such as a\
  \ sword,\na warhammer, or an axe.\nA typical monster makes a\nmelee attack when\

  \ and can thus\nattack targets within 5 feet of them when making a\nm elee attack.\n\
  Certain creatures (typically those larger\nthan Medium) have melee attacks with\

  \ attack when you teleport or when som eone\nor som ething m oves you without using\

  opportunity attack if an explosion hurls you out of a foe\u2019s\nreach or if gravity\
  \ causes you to fall past an enemy.\nTwo-W e a p o n F i g h t i n g\nW hen you\
  \ take the Attack action and attack with a light\nmelee weapon that you\u2019re\

  \ melee\nweapon that you\u2019re holding in the other hand.\nYou don\u2019t\nadd\
  \ your ability modifier to the damage of the bonus\nattack, unless that modifier\
  \ is negative.\nIf either weapon has the thrown property, you\ncan throw the weapon,\
  \ instead of making a melee\nattack with it.\nG r a p p l i n g\nW hen you want\
  \ to grab a creature or wrestle with it,\nyou can use the Attack action to make\
  \ a special melee\nattack, a grapple.\nIf you\u2019re able to make multiple attacks\n\
  with the Attack action, this attack replaces one of them.\nThe target of your grapple\
  \ must be no m ore than one\nsize larger than you, and it must be within your reach.\n\
  Using at least one free hand, you try to seize the target\nby making a grapple check,\
  \ a Strength (Athletics)\ncheck contested by the target\u2019s Strength (Athletics)\
  \ or\nDexterity (Acrobatics) check (the target chooses the\nability to use).\nIf\
  \ you succeed, you subject the target to\nthe grappled condition (see appendix A).\n\
  The condition\nspecifies the things that end it, and you can release the\ntarget\
  \ whenever you like (no action required).\nEscaping a Grapple.\nA grappled creature\
  \ can use its\naction to escape.\nTo do so, it must succeed on a Strength\n(Athletics)\
  \ or Dexterity (Acrobatics) check contested by\nyour Strength (Athletics) check.\n\
  Moving a Grappled Creature.\nW hen you move, you\ncan drag or carry the grappled\
  \ creature with you, but\nyour speed is halved, unless the creature is two or more\n\
  sizes smaller than you.\nS h o v i n g a C r e a t u r e\nUsing the Attack action,\
  \ you can make a special melee\nattack to shove a creature, either to knock it prone\
  \ or\npush it away from you.\nIf you\u2019re able to make multiple\nattacks with\
  \ the Attack action, this attack replaces\none of them.\nThe target of your shove\
  \ must be no m ore than one\nsize larger than you, and it must be within your reach.\n\
  You make a Strength (Athletics) check contested by the\ntarget\u2019s Strength (Athletics)\

  \ you win\nthe contest, you either knock the target prone or push\nit 5 feet away\
  \ from you.\nC o v e r\nWalls, trees, creatures, and other obstacles can provide\n\
  cover during combat, making a target m ore difficult\nto harm.\nA target can benefit\
  \ from cover only when an\nattack or other effect originates on the opposite side\n\
  of the cover.\nThere are three degrees of cover.\nIf a target is behind\nmultiple\
  \ sources of cover, only the most protective\ndegree o f cover applies; the degrees\
  \ aren't added\ntogether.\nFor example, if a target is behind a creature\nthat gives\
  \ half cover and a tree trunk that gives three-\nquarters cover, the target has\
  \ three-quarters cover.\nA target with half cover has a +2 bonus to AC and\nDexterity\
  \ saving throws.\nA target has half cover if an\nobstacle blocks at least half of\
  \ its body.\nThe obstacle\nmight be a low wall, a large piece of furniture, a narrow\n\
  tree trunk, or a creature, whether that creature is an\nenemy or a friend.\nA target\
  \ with three-quarters cover has a +5 bonus\nto AC and Dexterity saving throws.\n\
  A target has three-\nquarters cover if about three-quarters of it is covered\nby\
  \ an obstacle.\nThe obstacle might be a portcullis, an\narrow slit, or a thick tree\
  \ trunk.\nA target with total cover can\u2019t be targeted directly\nby an attack\
  \ or a spell, although som e spells can reach\nsuch a target by including it in\
  \ an area of effect.\nA\ntarget has total cover if it is completely concealed by\n\
  an obstacle.\nD a m a g e a n d H e a l in g\nInjury and the risk of death are constant\
  \ com panions\nof those who explore the w orlds of D&D.\nThe thrust of\na sword,\
  \ a well-placed arrow, or a blast of flame from a\nfireball spell all have the potential\
  \ to damage, or even\nkill, the hardiest of creatures.\nH i t P o i n t s\nHit points\
  \ represent a combination of physical and\nmental durability, the will to live,\
  \ and luck.\nCreatures\nwith m ore hit points are m ore difficult to kill.\nThose\n\
  with fewer hit points are m ore fragile.\nA creature\u2019s current hit points (usually\
  \ just called hit\npoints) can be any number from the creature\u2019s hit point\n\
  maximum down to 0.\nThis number changes frequently\nas a creature takes damage or\
  \ receives healing.\nW henever a creature takes damage, that damage is\nsubtracted\
  \ from its hit points.\nThe loss of hit points has\nno effect on a creature\u2019\
  s capabilities until the creature\ndrops to 0 hit points.\nD a m a g e R o l l s\n\
  Each weapon, spell, and harmful monster ability\nspecifies the damage it deals.\n\
  You roll the damage die\nor dice, add any modifiers, and apply the damage to\nyour\
  \ target.\nMagic weapons, special abilities, and other\nfactors can grant a bonus\
  \ to damage.\nW hen attacking with a weapon, you add your ability\nmodifier\u2014\
  the same modifier used for the attack roll\u2014\nto the damage.\nA spell tells\
  \ you which dice to roll for\ndamage and whether to add any modifiers.\nIf a spell\
  \ or other effect deals damage to more than\none target at the sam e time, roll\
  \ the damage once for\nall of them.\nFor example, when a wizard casts fireball or\n\
  a cleric casts flame strike, the spell\u2019s damage is rolled\nonce for all creatures\
  \ caught in the blast.\nC r i t i c a l H it s\nW hen you score a critical hit,\

  Roll all of the\nattack\u2019s damage dice twice and add them together.\nThen\n\
  add any relevant modifiers as normal.\nTo speed up play,\nyou can roll all the damage\
  \ dice at once.\nFor example, if you score a critical hit with a dagger,\nroll 2d4\
  \ for the damage, rather than 1d4, and then add\nyour relevant ability modifier.\n\
  If the attack involves other\ndamage dice, such as from the rogue\u2019s Sneak Attack\n\
  feature, you roll those dice twice as well.\nD a m a g e T y p e s\nDifferent attacks,\
  \ damaging spells, and other harmful\neffects deal different types of damage.\n\
  Damage types\nhave no rules of their own, but other rules, such as\ndamage resistance,\
  \ rely on the types.\nThe damage types follow, with examples to help a\nDM assign\
  \ a damage type to a new effect.\nAcid.\nThe corrosive spray of a black dragon\u2019\
  s breath\nand the dissolving enzym es secreted by a black pudding\ndeal acid damage.\n\
  Bludgeoning.\nBlunt force attacks\u2014hammers, falling,\nconstriction, and the\
  \ like\u2014deal bludgeoning damage.\nCold.\nThe infernal chill radiating from an\
  \ ice devil\u2019s\nspear and the frigid blast of a white dragon\u2019s breath\n\
  deal cold damage.\nFire.\nRed dragons breathe fire, and many spells\nconjure flames\
  \ to deal fire damage.\nForce.\nForce is pure magical energy focused into a\ndamaging\
  \ form.\nMost effects that deal force damage are\nspells, including magic missile\
  \ and spiritual weapon.\nLightning.\nA lightning bolt spell and a blue dragon\u2019\
  s\nbreath deal lightning damage.\nNecrotic.\nNecrotic damage, dealt by certain undead\n\
  and a spell such as chill touch, withers matter and\neven the soul.\nPiercing.\n\
  Puncturing and impaling attacks, including\nspears and m onsters\u2019 bites, deal\
  \ piercing damage.\nPoison.\nVenomous stings and the toxic gas o f a green\ndragon\u2019\
  s breath deal poison damage.\nPsychic.\nMental abilities such as a mind flayer\u2019\
  s\npsionic blast deal psychic damage.\nRadiant.\nRadiant damage, dealt by a cleric\u2019\
  s flame\nstrike spell or an angel\u2019s smiting weapon, sears the flesh\nlike fire\
  \ and overloads the spirit with power.\nSlashing.\nSwords, axes, and m onsters\u2019\
  \ claws deal\nslashing damage.\nThunder.\nA concussive burst of sound, such as the\n\
  effect o f the thunderwave spell, deals thunder damage.\nD a m a g e R e s i s t\
  \ a n c e a n d\nV u l n e r a b i l i t y\nS om e creatures and objects are exceedingly\
  \ difficult or\nunusually easy to hurt with certain types of damage.\nIf a creature\
  \ or an object has resistance to a damage\ntype, damage of that type is halved against\
  \ it.\nIf a\ncreature or an object has vulnerability to a damage\ntype, damage of\
  \ that type is doubled against it.\nResistance and then vulnerability are applied\
  \ after\nall other modifiers to damage.\nFor example, a creature\nhas resistance\
  \ to bludgeoning damage and is hit by an\nattack that deals 25 bludgeoning damage.\n\
  The creature\nis also within a m agical aura that reduces all damage by\n5.\nThe\
  \ 25 damage is first reduced by 5 and then halved,\nso the creature takes 10 damage.\n\
  Multiple instances of resistance or vulnerability that\naffect the sam e damage\
  \ type count as only one instance.\nFor example, if a creature has resistance to\
  \ fire damage\nas w ell as resistance to all nonm agical damage, the\ndamage of\
  \ a nonm agical fire is reduced by half against\nthe creature, not reduced by three-quarters.\n\
  H e a l i n g\nUnless it results in death, damage isn\u2019t permanent.\nEven\n\
  death is reversible through powerful magic.\nRest can\nrestore a creature's hit\
  \ points (as explained in chapter\n8), and magical m ethods such as a cure wounds\
  \ spell or\na potion of healing can remove damage in an instant.\nW hen a creature\
  \ receives healing of any kind, hit\npoints regained are added to its current hit\
  \ points.\nA\ncreature\u2019s hit points can\u2019t exceed its hit point maximum,\n\
  so any hit points regained in excess of this num ber are\nlost.\nFor example, a\
  \ druid grants a ranger 8 hit points of\nhealing.\nIf the ranger has 14 current\
  \ hit points and has a\nhit point maximum of 20, the ranger regains 6 hit points\n\
  from the druid, not 8.\nA creature that has died can\u2019t regain hit points until\n\
  magic such as the revivify spell has restored it to life.\nD r o p p i n g t o 0\
  \ H i t P o i n t s\nW hen you drop to 0 hit points, you either die outright or\n\
  fall unconscious, as explained in the following sections.\nI n s t a n t D e a t\
  \ h\nMassive damage can kill you instantly.\nW hen damage\nreduces you to 0 hit\
  \ points and there is damage\nremaining, you die if the remaining damage equals\n\
  or exceeds your hit point maximum.\nFor example, a cleric with a m aximum of\n12\
  \ hit points currently has 6 hit points.\nIf she\ntakes 18 damage from an attack,\
  \ she is reduced\nto 0 hit points, but 12 damage remains.\nBecause\nthe remaining\
  \ damage equals her hit point\nmaximum, the cleric dies.\nFa l l i n g U n c o n\
  \ s c i o u s\nIf damage reduces you to 0 hit points and fails to kill\nyou, you\
  \ fall unconscious (see appendix A).\nThis\nunconsciousness ends if you regain any\
  \ hit points.\nD e s c r i b i n g t h e E f f e c t s o f D a m a g e\nDungeon\
  \ Masters describe hit point loss in different ways.\nWhen your current hit point\
  \ total is half or more of your hit\npoint maximum, you typically show no signs\
  \ of injury.\nWhen\nyou drop below half your hit point maximum, you show signs\n\
  of wear, such as cuts and bruises.\nAn attack that reduces you\nto 0 hit points\
  \ strikes you directly, leaving a bleeding injury or\nother trauma, or it simply\
  \ knocks you unconscious.\nD e a t h Sa v i n g T h r o w s\nW henever you start\
  \ your turn with 0 hit points, you\nmust make a special saving throw, called a death\
  \ saving\nthrow, to determine whether you creep closer to death\nor hang onto life.\n\
  Unlike other saving throws, this one\nisn\u2019t tied to any ability score.\nYou\
  \ are in the hands of fate\nnow, aided only by spells and features that improve\
  \ your\nchances of succeeding on a saving throw.\nRoll a d20.\nIf the roll is 10\
  \ or higher, you succeed.\nOtherwise, you fail.\nA success or failure has no effect\n\
  by itself.\nOn your third success, you becom e stable (see\nbelow).\nOn your third\
  \ failure, you die.\nThe successes\nand failures don't need to be consecutive; keep\
  \ track\nof both until you collect three of a kind.\nThe number of\nboth is reset\
  \ to zero when you regain any hit points or\nbecom e stable.\nRolling 1 or 20.\n\
  W hen you make a death saving throw\nand roll a 1 on the d20, it counts as two failures.\n\
  If you\nroll a 20 on the d20, you regain 1 hit point.\nDamage at 0 Hit Points.\n\
  If you take any damage while\nyou have 0 hit points, you suffer a death saving throw\n\
  failure.\nIf the damage is from a critical hit, you suffer\ntwo failures instead.\n\
  If the damage equals or exceeds\nyour hit point maximum, you suffer instant death.\n\
  St a b i l i z i n g a C r e a t u r e\nThe best way to save a creature with 0 hit\
  \ points is to\nheal it.\nIf healing is unavailable, the creature can at\nleast\
  \ be stabilized so that it isn\u2019t killed by a failed death\nsaving throw.\n\
  You can use your action to administer first aid to an\nunconscious creature and\
  \ attempt to stabilize it, which\nrequires a successful DC 10 W isdom (Medicine)\
  \ check.\nA stable creature doesn\u2019t make death saving throws,\neven though\
  \ it has 0 hit points, but it does remain\nunconscious.\nThe creature stops being\
  \ stable, and must\nstart making death saving throws again, if it takes any\ndamage.\n\
  A stable creature that isn\u2019t healed regains\n1 hit point after 1d4 hours.\n\
  M o n s t e r s a n d D e a t h\nMost DMs have a monster die the instant it drops\
  \ to\n0 hit points, rather than having it fall unconscious and\nmake death saving\
  \ throws.\nMighty villains and special nonplayer characters\nare com m on exceptions;\
  \ the DM might have them\nfall unconscious and follow the sam e rules as\nplayer\
  \ characters.\nK n o c k i n g a C r e a t u r e O u t\nSom etim es an attacker\
  \ wants to incapacitate a foe,\nrather than deal a killing blow.\nW hen an attacker\n\
  reduces a creature to 0 hit points with a melee attack,\nthe attacker can knock\
  \ the creature out.\nThe attacker\ncan make this choice the instant the damage is\
  \ dealt.\nThe creature falls unconscious and is stable.\nT e m p o r a r y H i t\
  \ P o i n t s\nSom e spells and special abilities confer temporary hit\npoints to\
  \ a creature.\nTemporary hit points aren\u2019t actual\nhit points; they are a buffer\
  \ against damage, a pool of hit\npoints that protect you from injury.\nW hen you\
  \ have temporary hit points and take damage,\nthe temporary hit points are lost\
  \ first, and any leftover\ndamage carries over to your normal hit points.\nFor\n\
  example, if you have 5 temporary hit points and take\n7 damage, you lose the temporary\
  \ hit points and then\ntake 2 damage.\nBecause temporary hit points are separate\
  \ from\nyour actual hit points, they can exceed your hit point\nmaximum.\nA character\
  \ can, therefore, be at full hit\npoints and receive temporary hit points.\nHealing\
  \ can\u2019t restore temporary hit points, and they\ncan\u2019t be added together.\n\
  If you have temporary hit points\nand receive m ore of them, you decide whether\
  \ to keep\nthe ones you have or to gain the new ones.\nFor example,\nif a spell\
  \ grants you 12 temporary hit points when you\nalready have 10, you can have 12\
  \ or 10, not 22.\nIf you have 0 hit points, receiving temporary hit points\ndoesn\u2019\
  t restore you to consciousness or stabilize you.\nThey can still absorb damage directed\
  \ at you while\nyou\u2019re in that state, but only true healing can save you.\n\
  Unless a feature that grants you temporary hit points\nhas a duration, they last\
  \ until they\u2019re depleted or you\nfinish a long rest.\nM o u n t e d C o m b\
  \ a t\nA knight charging into battle on a warhorse, a wizard\ncasting spells from\
  \ the back of a griffon, or a cleric\nsoaring through the sky on a pegasus all enjoy\
  \ the\nbenefits of speed and mobility that a mount can provide.\nA willing creature\
  \ that is at least one size larger than\nyou and that has an appropriate anatomy\
  \ can serve as a\nmount, using the following rules.\nM o u n t i n g a n d D i s\
  \ m o u n t i n g\nOnce during your move, you can mount a creature that\nis within\
  \ 5 feet of you or dismount.\nDoing so costs an\namount of movement equal to half\
  \ your speed.\nFor\nexample, if your speed is 30 feet, you must spend 15\nfeet of\
  \ movement to mount a horse.\nTherefore, you can\u2019t\nmount it if you don\u2019\
  t have 15 feet o f movement left or\nif your speed is 0.\nIf an effect m oves your\
  \ mount against its w ill while\nyou\u2019re on it, you must succeed on a DC 10\
  \ Dexterity\nsaving throw or fall off the mount, landing prone in a\nspace within\
  \ 5 feet of it.\nIf you\u2019re knocked prone while\nmounted, you must make the\
  \ same saving throw.\nIf your mount is knocked prone, you can use your\nreaction\
  \ to dismount it as it falls and land on your feet.\nOtherwise, you are dismounted\
  \ and fall prone in a\nspace within 5 feet it.\nC o n t r o l l i n g a M o u n\
  \ t\nW hile you're mounted, you have two options.\nYou\ncan either control the mount\
  \ or allow it to act\nindependently.\nIntelligent creatures, such as dragons,\n\
  act independently.\nYou can control a mount only if it has been trained\nto accept\
  \ a rider.\nDom esticated horses, donkeys, and\nsimilar creatures are assum ed to\
  \ have such training.\nThe initiative of a controlled mount changes to match\nyours\
  \ when you mount it.\nIt m oves as you direct it, and\nit has only three action\
  \ options: Dash, Disengage, and\nDodge.\nA controlled mount can move and act even\
  \ on\nthe turn that you mount it.\nAn independent mount retains its place in the\n\
  initiative order.\nBearing a rider puts no restrictions on\nthe actions the mount\
  \ can take, and it m oves and acts\nas it wishes.\nIt might flee from combat, rush\
  \ to attack\nand devour a badly injured foe, or otherwise act against\nyour wishes.\n\
  In either case, if the mount provokes an opportunity\nattack while you\u2019re on\
  \ it, the attacker can target you\nor the mount.\nU n d e r w a t e r C o m b a\
  \ t\nW hen adventurers pursue sahuagin back to their\nundersea homes, fight off\
  \ sharks in an ancient\nshipwreck, or find themselves in a flooded dungeon\nroom\
  \ , they must fight in a challenging environment.\nUnderwater the following rules\
  \ apply.\nW hen making a melee weapon attack, a creature\nthat doesn\u2019t have\
  \ a swim m ing speed (either natural or\ngranted by magic) has disadvantage on the\
  \ attack roll\nunless the weapon is a dagger, javelin, shortsword,\nspear, or trident.\n\
  A ranged weapon attack automatically m isses\na target beyond the w eapon\u2019\
  s normal range.\nEven\nagainst a target within normal range, the attack roll has\n\
  disadvantage unless the weapon is a crossbow, a net, or\na weapon that is thrown\
  \ like a javelin (including a spear,\ntrident, or dart).\nCreatures and objects\

  \ e r 10: Sp e l l c a s t i n g\nM\nAGIC PERMEATES THE WORLDS OF D&D AND\nmost\
  \ often appears in the form o f a spell.\nThis chapter provides the rules for\n\
  casting spells.\nDifferent character\nclasses have distinctive ways of learning\n\
  and preparing their spells, and monsters\nuse spells in unique ways.\nRegardless\
  \ of its source,\na spell follows the rules here.\nW h a t I s a Spell?\nA spell\
  \ is a discrete magical effect, a single shaping\nof the magical energies that suffuse\
  \ the multiverse\ninto a specific, limited expression.\nIn casting a spell,\na character\
  \ carefully plucks at the invisible strands of\nraw m agic suffusing the world,\
  \ pins them in place in a\nparticular pattern, sets them vibrating in a specific\
  \ way,\nand then releases them to unleash the desired effect\u2014in\nmost cases,\
  \ all in the span o f seconds.\nSpells can be versatile tools, weapons, or protective\n\
  wards.\nThey can deal damage or undo it, im pose or\nremove conditions (see appendix\
  \ A), drain life energy\naway, and restore life to the dead.\nUncounted thousands\
  \ of spells have been created\nover the course of the multiverse\u2019s history,\
  \ and many of\nthem are long forgotten.\nSom e might yet lie recorded in\ncrumbling\
  \ spellbooks hidden in ancient ruins or trapped\nin the minds of dead gods.\nOr\
  \ they might som eday be\nreinvented by a character who has am assed enough\npower\
  \ and w isdom to do so.\nS p e l l L e v e l\nEvery spell has a level from 0 to\
  \ 9.\nA spell\u2019s level is a\ngeneral indicator of how powerful it is, with the\
  \ lowly\n(but still impressive) magic missile at 1st level and\nthe earth-shaking\
  \ wish at 9th.\nCantrips\u2014simple but\npowerful spells that characters can cast\
  \ almost by rote\u2014\nare level 0.\nThe higher a spell\u2019s level, the higher\
  \ level a\nspellcaster must be to use that spell.\nSpell level and character level\
  \ don\u2019t correspond\ndirectly.\nTypically, a character has to be at least 17th\n\
  level, not 9th level, to cast a 9th-level spell.\nK n o w n a n d P r e p a r e\
  \ d S p e l l s\nBefore a spellcaster can use a spell, he or she must\nhave the\
  \ spell firmly fixed in mind, or must have access\nto the spell in a magic item.\n\
  M embers o f a few classes,\nincluding bards and sorcerers, have a limited list\
  \ of\nspells they know that are always fixed in mind.\nThe\nsame thing is true o\
  \ f many magic-using monsters.\nOther\nspellcasters, such as clerics and wizards,\
  \ undergo a\nprocess o f preparing spells.\nThis process varies for\ndifferent classes,\
  \ as detailed in their descriptions.\nC a s t i n g in A r m o r\nBecause of the\
  \ mental focus and precise gestures required\nfor spellcasting, you must be proficient\
  \ with the armor you\nare wearing to cast a spell.\nYou are otherwise too distracted\n\
  and physically hampered by your armor for spellcasting.\nIn every case, the number\
  \ o f spells a caster can\nhave fixed in mind at any given time depends on the\n\
  character\u2019s level.\nS p e l l S l o t s\nRegardless of how many spells a caster\
  \ knows or\nprepares, he or she can cast only a limited num ber of\nspells before\
  \ resting.\nManipulating the fabric of magic\nand channeling its energy into even\
  \ a simple spell is\nphysically and mentally taxing, and higher-level spells\nare\
  \ even m ore so.\nThus, each spellcasting class\u2019s\ndescription (except that\
  \ of the warlock) includes a table\nshowing how many spell slots of each spell level\
  \ a\ncharacter can use at each character level.\nFor example,\nthe 3rd-level wizard\
  \ Umara has four 1st-level spell slots\nand two 2nd-level slots.\nW hen a character\
  \ casts a spell, he or she expends\na slot of that spell\u2019s level or higher,\
  \ effectively \u201Cfilling\u201D\na slot with the spell.\nYou can think of a spell\
  \ slot as a\ngroove of a certain size\u2014small for a 1st-level slot, larger\n\
  for a spell of higher level.\nA 1st-level spell fits into a slot\nof any size, but\
  \ a 9th-level spell fits only in a 9th-level\nslot.\nS o when Umara casts magic\
  \ missile, a 1st-level\nspell, she spends one of her four 1st-level slots and has\n\
  three remaining.\nFinishing a long rest restores any expended spell slots\n(see\
  \ chapter 8 for the rules on resting).\nSom e characters and m onsters have special\
  \ abilities\nthat let them cast spells without using spell slots.\nFor\nexample,\
  \ a m onk who follows the Way o f the Four\nElements, a warlock who chooses certain\
  \ eldritch\ninvocations, and a pit fiend from the Nine Hells can all\ncast spells\
  \ in such a way.\nC a s t i n g a S p e l l a t a H i g h e r L e v e l\nW hen a\
  \ spellcaster casts a spell using a slot that is of a\nhigher level than the spell,\
  \ the spell assum es the higher\nlevel for that casting.\nFor instance, if Umara\
  \ casts magic\nmissile using one of her 2nd-level slots, that magic\nmissile is\
  \ 2nd level.\nEffectively, the spell expands to fill\nthe slot it is put into.\n\
  Som e spells, such as magic missile and cure wounds,\nhave m ore powerful effects\
  \ when cast at a higher level,\nas detailed in a spell\u2019s description.\nC a\
  \ n t r i p s\nA cantrip is a spell that can be cast at will, without\nusing a spell\
  \ slot and without being prepared in\nadvance.\nRepeated practice has fixed the\
  \ spell in the\ncaster\u2019s mind and infused the caster with the magic\nneeded\
  \ to produce the effect over and over.\nA cantrip\u2019s\nspell level is 0.\nR i\
  \ t u a l s\nCertain spells have a special tag: ritual.\nSuch a spell\ncan be cast\
  \ following the norm al rules for spellcasting,\nor the spell can be cast as a ritual.\n\
  The ritual version of\na spell takes 10 minutes longer to cast than normal.\nIt\
  \ also doesn\u2019t expend a spell slot, which m eans the\nritual version of a spell\
  \ can\u2019t be cast at a higher level.\nTo cast a spell as a ritual, a spellcaster\
  \ must have a\nfeature that grants the ability to do so.\nThe cleric and the\ndruid,\
  \ for example, have such a feature.\nThe caster must\nalso have the spell prepared\
  \ or on his or her list of spells\nknown, unless the character\u2019s ritual feature\
  \ specifies\notherwise, as the wizard\u2019s does.\nC a s t i n g a Spell\nW hen\
  \ a character casts any spell, the sam e basic rules\nare followed, regardless of\
  \ the character\u2019s class or the\nspell\u2019s effects.\nEach spell description\
  \ in chapter 11 begins with a block\nof information, including the spell\u2019s\
  \ name, level, school\nof magic, casting time, range, components, and duration.\n\
  The rest of a spell entry describes the spell\u2019s effect.\nC a s t i n g T i\
  \ m e\nMost spells require a single action to cast, but som e\nspells require a\
  \ bonus action, a reaction, or much more\ntime to cast.\nB o n u s A c t i o n\n\
  A spell cast with a bonus action is especially swift.\nYou\nmust use a bonus action\
  \ on your turn to cast the spell,\nprovided that you haven\u2019t already taken\
  \ a bonus action\nthis turn.\nYou can\u2019t cast another spell during the same\n\
  turn, except for a cantrip with a casting time of 1 action.\nR e a c t i o n s\n\
  Som e spells can be cast as reactions.\nThese spells\ntake a fraction of a second\
  \ to bring about and are cast\nin response to som e event.\nIf a spell can be cast\
  \ as a\nreaction, the spell description tells you exactly when\nyou can do so.\n\
  L o n g e r C a s t i n g T im e s\nCertain spells (including spells cast as rituals)\
  \ require\nm ore time to cast: minutes or even hours.\nW hen you\ncast a spell with\
  \ a casting time longer than a single\naction or reaction, you must spend your action\
  \ each\nturn casting the spell, and you must maintain your\nconcentration while\
  \ you do so (see \u201CConcentration\u201D\nbelow).\nIf your concentration is broken,\
  \ the spell fails,\nbut you don\u2019t expend a spell slot.\nIf you want to try\n\
  casting the spell again, you must start over.\nR a n g e\nThe target of a spell\
  \ must be within the spell\u2019s range.\nFor a spell like magic missile, the target\
  \ is a creature.\nFor a spell like fireball, the target is the point in space\n\
  where the ball of fire erupts.\nM ost spells have ranges expressed in feet.\nSom\
  \ e\nspells can target only a creature (including you) that you\ntouch.\nOther spells,\
  \ such as the shield spell, affect only\nyou.\nThese spells have a range of self.\n\
  Spells that create cones or lines of effect that originate\nfrom you also have a\
  \ range o f self, indicating that the\norigin point of the spell\u2019s effect must\
  \ be you (see \u201CAreas\no f Effect\u201D later in the this chapter).\nOnce a\
  \ spell is cast, its effects aren\u2019t limited by its\nrange, unless the spell\u2019\
  s description says otherwise.\nC o m p o n e n t s\nA spell\u2019s com ponents are\
  \ the physical requirements you\nmust meet in order to cast it.\nEach spell\u2019\
  s description\nindicates whether it requires verbal (V), som atic (S),\nor material\
  \ (M) com ponents.\nIf you can\u2019t provide one\nor m ore of a spell\u2019s com\
  \ ponents, you are unable to\ncast the spell.\nV e r b a l (V )\nMost spells require\
  \ the chanting of mystic words.\nThe\nw ords themselves aren\u2019t the source o\
  \ f the spell\u2019s power;\nrather, the particular combination of sounds, with\n\
  specific pitch and resonance, sets the threads of magic\nin motion.\nThus, a character\
  \ who is gagged or in an area\nof silence, such as one created by the silence spell,\
  \ can\u2019t\ncast a spell with a verbal component.\nS o m a t i c (S)\nSpellcasting\
  \ gestures might include a forceful\ngesticulation or an intricate set of gestures.\n\
  If a spell\nrequires a som atic component, the caster must have free\nuse of at\
  \ least one hand to perform these gestures.\nM a t e r i a l (M )\nCasting som e\
  \ spells requires particular objects,\nspecified in parentheses in the com ponent\
  \ entry.\nA character can use a component pouch or a\nspellcasting focus (found\
  \ in chapter 5) in place of\nthe com ponents specified for a spell.\nBut if a cost\
  \ is\nindicated for a component, a character must have that\nspecific com ponent\
  \ before he or she can cast the spell.\nIf a spell states that a material com ponent\
  \ is\nconsum ed by the spell, the caster must provide this\ncom ponent for each\
  \ casting of the spell.\nA spellcaster must have a hand free to access these\ncom\
  \ ponents, but it can be the sam e hand that he or she\nuses to perform som atic\
  \ components.\nD u r a t i o n\nA spell's duration is the length of time the spell\
  \ persists.\nA duration can be expressed in rounds, minutes, hours,\nor even years.\n\
  Som e spells specify that their effects last\nuntil the spells are dispelled or\
  \ destroyed.\nI n s t a n t a n e o u s\nMany spells are instantaneous.\nThe spell\
  \ harms,\nheals, creates, or alters a creature or an object in a way\nthat can\u2019\
  t be dispelled, because its magic exists only\nfor an instant.\nC o n c e n t r\
  \ a t i o n\nSom e spells require you to maintain concentration\nin order to keep\
  \ their m agic active.\nIf you lose\nconcentration, such a spell ends.\nIf a spell\
  \ must be maintained with concentration,\nthat fact appears in its Duration entry,\
  \ and the spell\nspecifies how long you can concentrate on it.\nYou can\nend concentration\
  \ at any time (no action required).\nT h e S c h o o l s o f M a g i c\nAcademies\
  \ of magic group spells into eight categories called\nschools of magic.\nScholars,\
  \ particularly wizards, apply these\ncategories to all spells, believing that all\
  \ magic functions in\nessentially the same way, whether it derives from rigorous\n\
  study or is bestowed by a deity.\nThe schools of magic help describe spells; they\
  \ have no\nrules of their own, although some rules refer to the schools.\nAbjuration\
  \ spells are protective in nature, though some\nof them have aggressive uses.\n\
  They create magical barriers,\nnegate harmful effects, harm trespassers, or banish\
  \ creatures\nto other planes of existence.\nConjuration spells involve the transportation\
  \ of objects\nand creatures from one location to another.\nSome spells\nsummon creatures\
  \ or objects to the caster\u2019s side, whereas\nothers allow the caster to teleport\
  \ to another location.\nSome\nconjurations create objects or effects out of nothing.\n\
  Divination spells reveal information, whether in the form of\nsecrets long forgotten,\
  \ glimpses of the future, the locations\nof hidden things, the truth behind illusions,\
  \ or visions of\ndistant people or places.\nEnchantment spells affect the minds\
  \ of others, influencing\nor controlling their behavior.\nSuch spells can make enemies\n\
  see the caster as a friend, force creatures to take a course of\naction, or even\
  \ control another creature like a puppet.\nEvocation spells manipulate magical energy\
  \ to produce a\ndesired effect.\nSome call up blasts of fire or lightning.\nOthers\n\
  channel positive energy to heal wounds.\nIllusion spells deceive the senses or minds\
  \ of others.\nThey\ncause people to see things that are not there, to miss things\n\
  that are there, to hear phantom noises, or to remember\nthings that never happened.\n\
  Some illusions create phantom\nimages that any creature can see, but the most insidious\n\
  illusions plant an image directly in the mind of a creature.\nNecromancy spells\
  \ manipulate the energies of life and\ndeath.\nSuch spells can grant an extra reserve\
  \ of life force,\ndrain the life energy from another creature, create the\nundead,\
  \ or even bring the dead back to life.\nCreating the undead through the use of necromancy\
  \ spells\nsuch as animate dead is not a good act, and only evil casters\nuse such\
  \ spells frequently.\nTransmutation spells change the properties of a creature,\n\
  object, or environment.\nThey might turn an enemy into a\nharmless creature, bolster\
  \ the strength of an ally, make an\nobject move at the caster\u2019s command, or\
  \ enhance a creature\u2019s\ninnate healing abilities to rapidly recover from injury.\n\
  Normal activity, such as moving and attacking, doesn\u2019t\ninterfere with concentration.\n\
  The following factors can\nbreak concentration:\n\u2022 Casting another spell that\
  \ requires concentration.\nYou lose concentration on a spell if you cast another\n\
  spell that requires concentration.\nYou can\u2019t concen\xAD\ntrate on two spells\
  \ at once.\n\u2022 Taking damage.\nWhenever you take damage while\nyou are concentrating\
  \ on a spell, you must make a\nConstitution saving throw to maintain your concentra\xAD\
  \ntion.\nThe DC equals 10 or half the damage you take,\nwhichever number is higher.\n\
  If you take damage from\nmultiple sources, such as an arrow and a dragon\u2019s\n\
  breath, you make a separate saving throw for each\nsource of damage.\n\u2022 Being\
  \ incapacitated or killed.\nYou lose concentration\non a spell if you are incapacitated\
  \ or if you die.\nThe DM might also decide that certain environmental\nphenomena,\
  \ such as a wave crashing over you while\nyou\u2019re on a storm -tossed ship, require\
  \ you to succeed\non a DC 10 Constitution saving throw to maintain\nconcentration\
  \ on a spell.\nT a r g e t s\nA typical spell requires you to pick one or more targets\n\
  to be affected by the spell\u2019s magic.\nA spell's description\ntells you whether\
  \ the spell targets creatures, objects, or\na point of origin for an area of effect\
  \ (described below).\nUnless a spell has a perceptible effect, a creature\nmight\
  \ not know it w as targeted by a spell at all.\nAn effect\nlike crackling lightning\
  \ is obvious, but a m ore subtle\neffect, such as an attempt to read a creature\u2019\
  s thoughts,\ntypically goes unnoticed, unless a spell says otherwise.\nA C l e a\
  \ r Pa t h t o t h e T a r g e t\nTo target something, you must have a clear path\
  \ to it,\nso it can\u2019t be behind total cover.\nIf you place an area of effect\
  \ at a point that you can\u2019t\nsee and an obstruction, such as a wall, is between\
  \ you\nand that point, the point o f origin com es into being on\nthe near side\
  \ of that obstruction.\nT a r g e t i n g Y o u r s e l f\nIf a spell targets a\
  \ creature of your choice, you can\nchoose yourself, unless the creature must be\
  \ hostile or\nspecifically a creature other than you.\nIf you are in the\narea of\
  \ effect of a spell you cast, you can target yourself.\nA r e a s o f E f f e c\
  \ t\nSpells such as burning hands and cone of cold cover an\narea, allowing them\
  \ to affect multiple creatures at once.\nA spell\u2019s description specifies its\
  \ area of effect,\nwhich typically has one of five different shapes: cone,\ncube,\
  \ cylinder, line, or sphere.\nEvery area of effect has\na point of origin, a location\
  \ from which the spell\u2019s\nenergy erupts.\nThe rules for each shape specify\
  \ how you\nposition its point of origin.\nTypically,\na point of origin is a point\
  \ in space, but\nsom e spells have an area w hose origin is a\ncreature or an object.\n\
  A spell\u2019s effect expands in straight lines from the point\nof origin.\nIf no\
  \ unblocked straight line extends from the\npoint of origin to a location within\
  \ the area of effect, that\nlocation isn\u2019t included in the spell\u2019s area.\n\
  To block one of\nthese imaginary lines, an obstruction must provide total\ncover,\
  \ as explained in chapter 9.\nC o n e\nA cone extends in a direction you choose\
  \ from its point\nof origin.\nA cone\u2019s width at a given point along its length\n\
  is equal to that point\u2019s distance from the point of origin.\nA cone\u2019s\
  \ area of effect specifies its maximum length.\nA cone\u2019s point of origin is\
  \ not included in the cone\u2019s\narea of effect, unless you decide otherwise.\n\
  C u b e\nYou select a cube\u2019s point of origin, which lies anywhere\non a face\
  \ of the cubic effect.\nThe cube\u2019s size is expressed\nas the length of each\
  \ side.\nA cube\u2019s point of origin is not included in the cube\u2019s\narea\
  \ of effect, unless you decide otherwise.\nC y l i n d e r\nA cylinder\u2019s point\
  \ of origin is the center of a circle of a\nparticular radius, as given in the spell\
  \ description.\nThe\ncircle must either be on the ground or at the height of\nthe\
  \ spell effect.\nThe energy in a cylinder expands in\nstraight lines from the point\
  \ of origin to the perimeter of\nthe circle, forming the base of the cylinder.\n\
  The spell\u2019s\neffect then shoots up from the base or down from the\ntop, to\
  \ a distance equal to the height of the cylinder.\nA cylinder\u2019s point of origin\
  \ is included in the cylinder\u2019s\narea of effect.\nL in e\nA line extends from\
  \ its point of origin in a straight path\nup to its length and covers an area defined\
  \ by its width.\nA line\u2019s point of origin is not included in the line\u2019\
  s area\nof effect, unless you decide otherwise.\nS p h e r e\nYou select a sphere\u2019\
  s point of origin, and the sphere\nextends outward from that point.\nThe sphere\u2019\
  s\nsize is expressed as a radius in feet that extends\nfrom the point.\nA sphere\u2019\
  s point of origin is included in the sphere\u2019s\narea of effect.\nS a v i n g\
  \ T h r o w s\nMany spells specify that a target can make a saving\nthrow to avoid\
  \ som e or all of a spell\u2019s effects.\nThe spell\nspecifies the ability that\
  \ the target uses for the save and\nwhat happens on a success or failure.\nThe DC\
  \ to resist one of your spells equals 8 + your\nspellcasting ability modifier +\
  \ your proficiency bonus +\nany special modifiers.\nA t t a c k R o l l s\nSom e\
  \ spells require the caster to make an attack roll\nto determine whether the spell\
  \ effect hits the intended\ntarget.\nYour attack bonus with a spell attack equals\
  \ your\nspellcasting ability m odifier + your proficiency bonus.\nMost spells that\
  \ require attack rolls involve ranged\nattacks.\nRem ember that you have disadvantage\
  \ on a\nranged attack roll if you are within 5 feet of a hostile\ncreature that\
  \ can see you and that isn\u2019t incapacitated\n(see chapter 9).\nC o m b i n i\
  \ n g M a g i c a l E f f e c t s\nThe effects of different spells add together\
  \ while\nthe durations of those spells overlap.\nThe effects of\nthe same spell\
  \ cast multiple times don't combine,\nhowever.\nInstead, the m ost potent effect\u2014\
  such as the\nhighest bonus\u2014from those castings applies while their\ndurations\
  \ overlap.\nFor example, if two clerics cast bless on the same\ntarget, that character\
  \ gains the spell\u2019s benefit only\nonce; he or she doesn\u2019t get to roll\
  \ two bonus dice.\nT h e W e a v e o f M a g ic\nThe worlds within the D&D multiverse\
  \ are magical places.\nAll existence is suffused with magical power, and potential\n\
  energy lies untapped in every rock, stream, and living\ncreature, and even in the\
  \ air itself.\nRaw magic is the stuff of\ncreation, the mute and mindless will of\
  \ existence, permeating\nevery bit of matter and present in every manifestation\
  \ of\nenergy throughout the multiverse.\nMortals can\u2019t directly shape this\
  \ raw magic.\nInstead, they\nmake use of a fabric of magic, a kind of interface\
  \ between\nthe will of a spellcaster and the stuff of raw magic.\nThe\nspellcasters\
  \ of the Forgotten Realms call it the Weave and\nrecognize its essence as the goddess\
  \ Mystra, but casters\nhave varied ways of naming and visualizing this interface.\n\
  By\nany name, without the Weave, raw magic is locked away and\ninaccessible;the\
  \ most powerful archmage can't light a candle\nwith magic in an area where the Weave\
  \ has been torn.\nBut\nsurrounded by the Weave, a spellcaster can shape lightning\n\
  to blast foes, transport hundreds of miles in the blink of an\neye, or even reverse\
  \ death itself.\nAll magic depends on the Weave, though different kinds\nof magic\
  \ access it in a variety of ways.\nThe spells of wizards,\nwarlocks, sorcerers,\
  \ and bards are commonly called arcane\nmagic.\nThese spells rely on an understanding\u2014\
  \ learned or\nintuitive\u2014 of the workings of the Weave.\nThe caster plucks\n\
  directly at the strands of the Weave to create the desired\neffect.\nEldritch knights\
  \ and arcane tricksters also use arcane\nmagic.\nThe spells of clerics, druids,\
  \ paladins, and rangers are\ncalled divine magic.\nThese spellcasters\u2019 access\
  \ to the Weave\nis mediated by divine power\u2014 gods, the divine forces of\nnature,\
  \ or the sacred weight of a paladin\u2019s oath.\nWhenever a magic effect is created,\
  \ the threads of the\nWeave intertwine, twist, and fold to make the effect possible.\n\
  When characters use divination spells such as detect magic or\nidentify, they glimpse\
  \ the Weave.\nA spell such as dispel magic\nsmooths the Weave.\nSpells such as antimagic\
  \ field rearrange\nthe Weave so that magic flows around, rather than through,\n\
  the area affected by the spell.\nAnd in places where the Weave\nis damaged or torn,\
  \ magic works in unpredictable ways\u2014 or\nnot at all.\nC h a p t e r 11: Sp\

  flying messenger, or 25 m iles for other animals.\nW hen the m essenger arrives,\

  Casting Time: 1 action\nRange: Self (10-foot radius)\nComponents: V, S\nDuration:\
  \ Concentration, up to 1 hour\nA shim mering barrier extends out from you in a 10-foot\n\
  radius and m oves with you, remaining centered on\nyou and hedging out creatures\
  \ other than undead and\nconstructs.\nThe barrier lasts for the duration.\nThe barrier\
  \ prevents an affected creature from\npassing or reaching through.\nAn affected\
  \ creature\ncan cast spells or make attacks with ranged or reach\nw eapons through\
  \ the barrier.\nIf you move so that an affected creature is forced to\npass through\

  Casting Time: 1 action\nRange: Self (10-foot-radius sphere)\nComponents: V, S, M\
  \ (a pinch of powdered iron or\niron filings)\nDuration: Concentration, up to 1\
  \ hour\nA 10-foot-radius invisible sphere of antimagic surrounds\nyou.\nThis area\
  \ is divorced from the magical energy that\nsuffuses the multiverse.\nWithin the\
  \ sphere, spells can\u2019t\nbe cast, sum m oned creatures disappear, and even m\
  \ agic\nitems becom e mundane.\nUntil the spell ends, the sphere\nm oves with you,\
  \ centered on you.\nSpells and other magical effects, except those created\nby an\
  \ artifact or a deity, are suppressed in the sphere\nand can\u2019t protrude into\
  \ it.\nA slot expended to cast\na suppressed spell is consum ed.\nW hile an effect\
  \ is\nsuppressed, it doesn\u2019t function, but the time it spends\nsuppressed counts\
  \ against its duration.\nTargeted Effects.\nSpells and other magical effects,\n\
  such as magic missile and charm person, that target\na creature or an object in\
  \ the sphere have no effect\non that target.\nAreas of Magic.\nThe area of another\
  \ spell or magical\neffect, such as fireball, can\u2019t extend into the sphere.\n\
  If the sphere overlaps an area of magic, the part of\nthe area that is covered by\
  \ the sphere is suppressed.\nFor example, the flames created by a wall o f fire\
  \ are\nsuppressed within the sphere, creating a gap in the wall\nif the overlap\
  \ is large enough.\nSpells.\nAny active spell or other magical effect on a\ncreature\
  \ or an object in the sphere is suppressed while\nthe creature or object is in it.\n\
  Magic Items.\nThe properties and powers of\nm agic items are suppressed in the sphere.\n\
  For\nexample, a +1 longsword in the sphere functions as a\nnonm agical longsword.\n\
  A m agic w eapon\u2019s properties and powers are\nsuppressed if it is used against\
  \ a target in the sphere or\nwielded by an attacker in the sphere.\nIf a magic weapon\n\
  or a piece of magic ammunition fully leaves the sphere\n(for example, if you fire\
  \ a m agic arrow or throw a magic\nspear at a target outside the sphere), the m\
  \ agic of the\nitem ceases to be suppressed as soon as it exits.\nMagical Travel.\n\
  Teleportation and planar travel\nfail to work in the sphere, whether the sphere\
  \ is the\ndestination or the departure point for such magical\ntravel.\nA portal\
  \ to another location, world, or plane of\nexistence, as well as an opening to an\
  \ extradimensional\nspace such as that created by the rope trick spell,\ntemporarily\
  \ closes while in the sphere.\nCreatures and Objects.\nA creature or object\nsum\
  \ m oned or created by m agic temporarily winks out\nof existence in the sphere.\n\
  Such a creature instantly\nreappears once the space the creature occupied is no\n\
  longer within the sphere.\nDispel Magic.\nSpells and magical effects such as\ndispel\
  \ magic have no effect on the sphere.\nLikewise, the\nspheres created by different\
  \ antimagic field spells don\u2019t\nnullify each other.\nA n t i p a t h y / S\
  \ y m p a t h y\n8 th-level enchantment\nCasting Time: 1 hour\nRange: 60 feet\n\
  Components: V, S, M (either a lump of alum soaked in\nvinegar for the antipathy\
  \ effect or a drop of honey for\nthe sympathy effect)\nDuration: 10 days\nThis spell\
  \ attracts or repels creatures of your choice.\nYou target som ething within range,\
  \ either a Huge or\nsmaller object or creature or an area that is no larger\nthan\
  \ a 200-foot cube.\nThen specify a kind of intelligent\ncreature, such as red dragons,\
  \ goblins, or vampires.\nYou invest the target with an aura that either attracts\
  \ or\nrepels the specified creatures for the duration.\nChoose\nantipathy or sympathy\
  \ as the aura\u2019s effect.\nAntipathy.\nThe enchantment causes creatures of the\n\
  kind you designated to feel an intense urge to leave the\narea and avoid the target.\n\
  W hen such a creature can\nsee the target or com es within 60 feet of it, the creature\n\
  must succeed on a W isdom saving throw or becom e\nfrightened.\nThe creature remains\
  \ frightened while it can\nsee the target or is within 60 feet of it.\nW hile frightened\n\
  by the target, the creature must use its movement to\nmove to the nearest safe spot\
  \ from which it can\u2019t see\nthe target.\nIf the creature m oves m ore than 60\
  \ feet from\nthe target and can\u2019t see it, the creature is no longer\nfrightened,\
  \ but the creature becom es frightened again if\nit regains sight of the target\
  \ or m oves within 60 feet o f it.\nSympathy.\nThe enchantment causes the specified\n\
  creatures to feel an intense urge to approach the target\nwhile within 60 feet o\
  \ f it or able to see it.\nW hen such a\ncreature can see the target or com es within\
  \ 60 feet of it,\nthe creature must succeed on a W isdom saving throw or\nuse its\
  \ movement on each o f its turns to enter the area\nor move within reach of the\
  \ target.\nW hen the creature\nhas done so, it can\u2019t willingly move away from\
  \ the target.\nIf the target dam ages or otherwise harms an affected\ncreature,\
  \ the affected creature can make a W isdom\nsaving throw to end the effect, as described\
  \ below.\nEnding the Effect.\nIf an affected creature ends its\nturn while not within\
  \ 60 feet of the target or able to see\nit, the creature makes a W isdom saving\
  \ throw.\nOn a\nsuccessful save, the creature is no longer affected by\nthe target\
  \ and recognizes the feeling o f repugnance or\nattraction as magical.\nIn addition,\
  \ a creature affected by\nthe spell is allowed another W isdom saving throw every\n\
  24 hours while the spell persists.\nA creature that successfully saves against this\
  \ effect\nis immune to it for 1 minute, after which time it can be\naffected again.\n\
  A r c a n e E y e\n4th-level divination\nCasting Time: 1 action\nRange: 30 feet\n\
  Components: V, S, M (a bit of bat fur)\nDuration: Concentration, up to 1 hour\n\
  You create an invisible, magical eye within range that\nhovers in the air for the\
  \ duration.\nYou mentally receive visual information from the eye,\nwhich has normal\
  \ vision and darkvision out to 30 feet.\nThe eye can look in every direction.\n\
  As an action, you can move the eye up to 30 feet in\nany direction.\nThere is no\
  \ limit to how far away from\nyou the eye can move, but it can\u2019t enter another\
  \ plane\no f existence.\nA solid barrier blocks the eye\u2019s movement,\nbut the\
  \ eye can pass through an opening as small as 1\ninch in diameter.\nA r c a n e\
  \ G a t e\n6 th-level conjuration\nCasting Time: 1 action\nRange: 500 feet\nComponents:\
  \ V, S\nDuration: Concentration, up to 10 minutes\nYou create linked teleportation\
  \ portals that remain open\nfor the duration.\nC hoose two points on the ground\
  \ that\nyou can see, one point within 10 feet of you and one\npoint within 500 feet\
  \ of you.\nA circular portal, 10 feet\nin diameter, opens over each point.\nIf the\
  \ portal would\nopen in the space occupied by a creature, the spell fails,\nand\
  \ the casting is lost.\nThe portals are two-dimensional glowing rings\nfilled with\
  \ mist, hovering inches from the ground and\nperpendicular to it at the points you\
  \ choose.\nA ring is\nvisible only from one side (your choice), which is the side\n\
  that functions as a portal.\nAny creature or object entering the portal exits from\n\
  the other portal as if the two were adjacent to each\nother; passing through a portal\
  \ from the nonportal side\nhas no effect.\nThe mist that fills each portal is opaque\n\
  and blocks vision through it.\nOn your turn, you can\nrotate the rings as a bonus\
  \ action so that the active side\nfaces in a different direction.\nA r c a n e L\
  \ o c k\n2nd-level abjuration\nCasting Time: 1 action\nRange: Touch\nComponents:\
  \ V, S, M (gold dust w orth at least 25 gp,\nwhich the spell consum es)\nDuration:\

  \ and it becom es locked for the duration.\nYou\nand the creatures you designate\
  \ when you cast this\nspell can open the object normally.\nYou can also set a\n\
  password that, when spoken within 5 feet of the object,\nsuppresses this spell for\
  \ 1 minute.\nOtherwise, it is\nim passable until it is broken or the spell is dispelled\
  \ or\nsuppressed.\nCasting knock on the object suppresses\narcane lock for 10 minutes.\n\
  W hile affected by this spell, the object is m ore difficult\nto break or force\

  an action, you can either shift your attention to another\ncreature\u2019s thoughts\

  insight into its reasoning (if any), its emotional state,\nand som ething that loom\
  \ s large in its mind (such as\nsom ething it w orries over, loves, or hates).\n\
  If it succeeds,\nthe spell ends.\nEither way, the target knows that you are\nprobing\

  s thoughts, the creature can use\nits action on its turn to make an Intelligence\

  Questions verbally directed at the target creature\nnaturally shape the course of\

  target\u2019s dream s and can converse with the target as\nlong as it remains asleep,\
  \ through the duration of the\nspell.\nThe m essenger can also shape the environment\n\
  of the dream, creating landscapes, objects, and other\nimages.\nThe m essenger can\

  The\nextent of any such changes can\u2019t exceed half the area\u2019s\nlargest\

  \ you can see within range.\nThe target must\nmake an Intelligence saving throw.\n\
  On a failed save, you\ncreate a phantasmal object, creature, or other visible\n\
  phenom enon of your choice that is no larger than a\n10-foot cube and that is perceivable\
  \ only to the target\nfor the duration.\nThis spell has no effect on undead\nor\

  with an Intelligence (Investigation) check against your\nspell save DC.\nIf the\
  \ check succeeds, the target realizes\nthat the phantasm is an illusion, and the\
  \ spell ends.\nW hile a target is affected by the spell, the target treats\nthe\
  \ phantasm as if it were real.\nThe target rationalizes\nany illogical outcom es\
  \ from interacting with the\nphantasm.\nFor example, a target attempting to walk\n\
  across a phantasmal bridge that spans a chasm falls\nonce it steps onto the bridge.\n\
  If the target survives the\nfall, it still believes that the bridge exists and com\
  \ es up\nwith som e other explanation for its fall\u2014it w as pushed,\nit slipped,\
  \ or a strong wind might have knocked it off.\nAn affected target is so convinced\
  \ of the phantasm\u2019s\nreality that it can even take damage from the illusion.\n\
  A\nphantasm created to appear as a creature can attack the\ntarget.\nSimilarly,\
  \ a phantasm created to appear as fire, a\npool of acid, or lava can burn the target.\n\
  Each round on\nyour turn, the phantasm can deal 1d6 psychic damage\nto the target\
  \ if it is in the phantasm\u2019s area or within 5\nfeet of the phantasm, provided\
  \ that the illusion is of a\ncreature or hazard that could logically deal damage,\n\
  such as by attacking.\nThe target perceives the damage\nas a type appropriate to\

  \ it has a speed of 100 feet and can\ntravel 10 miles in an hour, or 13 m iles at\

  W hen the creature appears, it is under no com pulsion\nto behave in any particular\

  \ to com m unicate with the creature to bargain for\nits services.\nPayment can\
  \ take a variety of forms.\nA celestial might\nrequire a sizable donation of gold\
  \ or m agic items to\nan allied temple, while a fiend might demand a living\nsacrifice\
  \ or a gift of treasure.\nSom e creatures might\nexchange their service for a quest\
  \ undertaken by you.\nAs a rule of thumb, a task that can be m easured in\nminutes\
  \ requires a payment worth 100 gp per minute.\nA\ntask m easured in hours requires\
  \ 1,000 gp per hour.\nAnd\na task m easured in days (up to 10 days) requires 10,000\n\
  gp per day.\nThe DM can adjust these payments based on\nthe circum stances under\
  \ which you cast the spell.\nIf the\ntask is aligned with the creature\u2019s ethos,\
  \ the payment\nmight be halved or even waived.\nNonhazardous tasks\ntypically require\
  \ only half the suggested payment, while\nespecially dangerous tasks might require\
  \ a greater gift.\nCreatures rarely accept tasks that seem suicidal.\nAfter the\
  \ creature com pletes the task, or when the\nagreed-upon duration of service expires,\

  \ to the task and if possible.\nIf you are\nunable to agree on a price for the creature\u2019\

  A shapechanger automatically succeeds on this\nsaving throw.\nThe transformation\
  \ lasts for the duration, or until\nthe target drops to 0 hit points or dies.\n\
  The new form\ncan be any beast w hose challenge rating is equal to or\nless than\
  \ the target\u2019s (or the target\u2019s level, if it doesn't\nhave a challenge\
  \ rating).\nThe target\u2019s game statistics,\nincluding mental ability scores,\
  \ are replaced by the\nstatistics of the chosen beast.\nIt retains its alignment\n\
  and personality.\nThe target assum es the hit points of its new form.\nW hen it\
  \ reverts to its normal form, the creature\nreturns to the number of hit points\
  \ it had before it\ntransformed.\nIf it reverts as a result of dropping to\n0 hit\
  \ points, any excess damage carries over to its\nnormal form.\nAs long as the excess\
  \ damage doesn\u2019t\nreduce the creature\u2019s normal form to 0 hit points, it\
  \ isn\u2019t\nknocked unconscious.\nThe creature is limited in the actions it can\
  \ perform by\nthe nature of its new form, and it can\u2019t speak, cast spells,\n\
  or take any other action that requires hands or speech.\nThe target\u2019s gear\
  \ melds into the new form.\nThe\ncreature can\u2019t activate, use, wield, or otherwise\
  \ benefit\nfrom any of its equipment.\nP o w e r W o r d H e a l\n9th-level evocation\n\

  \ condition can be as general or as\ndetailed as you like, though it must be based\
  \ on visual or\naudible conditions that occur within 30 feet of the area.\nFor example,\
  \ you could create an illusion of yourself\nto appear and warn off others who attempt\
  \ to open a\ntrapped door, or you could set the illusion to trigger only\nwhen a\
  \ creature says the correct w ord or phrase.\nPhysical interaction with the image\

  give each target you choose a new, illusory appearance.\nAn unwilling target can\
  \ make a Charisma saving throw,\nand if it succeeds, it is unaffected by this spell.\n\
  The spell disguises physical appearance as well as\nclothing, armor, weapons, and\
  \ equipment.\nYou can make\neach creature seem 1 foot shorter or taller and appear\n\
  thin, fat, or in between.\nYou can\u2019t change a target\u2019s body\ntype, so\
  \ you must choose a form that has the same\nbasic arrangement of limbs.\nOtherwise,\
  \ the extent of\nthe illusion is up to you.\nThe spell lasts for the duration,\n\
  unless you use your action to dism iss it sooner.\nThe changes wrought by this spell\
  \ fail to hold up to\nphysical inspection.\nFor example, if you use this spell\n\
  to add a hat to a creature\u2019s outfit, objects pass through\nthe hat, and anyone\
  \ who touches it would feel nothing\nor w ould feel the creature\u2019s head and\
  \ hair.\nIf you use\nthis spell to appear thinner than you are, the hand of\nsom\
  \ eone w ho reaches out to touch you would bump into\nyou while it was seem ingly\
  \ still in midair.\nA creature can use its action to inspect a target and\nmake\

  \ answer in a\nlike manner immediately.\nThe spell enables creatures\nwith Intelligence\
  \ scores of at least 1 to understand the\nmeaning of your message.\nYou can send\
  \ the m essage across any distance and\neven to other planes of existence, but if\

  You can set a condition for the spell to end early.\nThe condition can be anything\

  \ creature with\na challenge rating equal to your level or lower.\nThe\ncreature\
  \ can\u2019t be a construct or an undead, and you\nmust have seen the sort of creature\

  \ points and Hit Dice of the new\nform.\nWhen you revert to your normal form, you\n\
  return to the number o f hit points you had before you\ntransformed.\nIf you revert\
  \ as a result of dropping to\n0 hit points, any excess damage carries over to your\n\
  normal form.\nAs long as the excess damage doesn\u2019t\nreduce your normal form\
  \ to 0 hit points, you aren\u2019t\nknocked unconscious.\nYou retain the benefit\
  \ o f any features from your class,\nrace, or other source and can use them, provided\
  \ that\nyour new form is physically capable of doing so.\nYou\ncan\u2019t use any\
  \ special senses you have (for example,\ndarkvision) unless your new form also has\
  \ that sense.\nYou can only speak if the creature can normally speak.\nW hen you\
  \ transform, you choose whether your\nequipment falls to the ground, merges into\

  \ determines whether it is practical for\nthe new form to w ear a piece of equipment,\
  \ based on\nthe creature\u2019s shape and size.\nYour equipment doesn\u2019t\nchange\
  \ shape or size to match the new form, and any\nequipment that the new form can\u2019\
  t w ear must either fall\nto the ground or merge into your new form.\nEquipment\n\
  that merges has no effect in that state.\nDuring this spell\u2019s duration, you\
  \ can use your action to\nassume a different form following the same restrictions\n\
  and rules for the original form, with one exception: if\nyour new form has more\
  \ hit points than your current\none, your hit points remain at their current value.\n\

  \ and the spell ends\nwithout being triggered.\nThe glyph is nearly invisible, requiring\
  \ an Intelligence\n(Investigation) check against your spell save\nDC to find it.\n\
  You decide what triggers the glyph when you cast the\nspell.\nFor glyphs inscribed\
  \ on a surface, the most typical\ntriggers include touching or stepping on the glyph,\n\
  removing another object covering it, approaching within\na certain distance of it,\
  \ or manipulating the object\nthat holds it.\nFor glyphs inscribed within an object,\n\
  the most com m on triggers are opening the object,\napproaching within a certain\

  \ so the spell is\nactivated only under certain circum stances or according\nto\
  \ a creature\u2019s physical characteristics (such as height\nor weight), or physical\
  \ kind (for example, the ward could\nbe set to affect hags or shapechangers).\n\
  You can also\nspecify creatures that don\u2019t trigger the glyph, such as\nthose\
  \ who say a certain password.\nW hen you inscribe the glyph, choose one of the\n\
  options below for its effect.\nOnce triggered, the glyph\nglows, filling a 60-foot-radius\
  \ sphere with dim light\nfor 10 minutes, after which time the spell ends.\nEach\n\

  For example, if you tried to travel 120 miles, landed off\ntarget, and rolled a\

  \ throw.\nOn a failed\nsave, a creature becom es frightened for the duration.\n\
  The illusion calls on the creature\u2019s deepest fears,\nmanifesting its worst\
  \ nightmares as an implacable\nthreat.\nAt the start of each of the frightened creature\u2019\
  s\nturns, it must succeed on a W isdom saving throw or\ntake 4 d10 psychic damage.\n\

  \ can take in this form are the\nDash action or to revert to its normal form.\n\
  Reverting\ntakes 1 minute, during which time a creature is\nincapacitated and can\u2019\

  \ requires\nthe 1-minute transformation.\nIf a creature is in cloud form and flying\
  \ when the effect\nends, the creature descends 60 feet per round for 1\nminute until\

  \ way you choose so long as it\nmakes one continuous path along the ground.\nThe\
  \ wall\nlasts for the duration.\nW hen the wall appears, each creature within its\

  \ on a failed save, or half as\nmuch damage on a successful one.\nThe strong wind\
  \ keeps fog, smoke, and other gases at\nbay.\nSm all or smaller flying creatures\

  brought into the wall fly upward.\nArrows, bolts, and\nother ordinary projectiles\

  Casting Time: 1 action\nRange: Self\nComponents: V\nDuration: Instantaneous\nWish\
  \ is the mightiest spell a mortal creature can\ncast.\nBy simply speaking aloud,\
  \ you can alter the very\nfoundations of reality in accord with your desires.\n\
  The basic use of this spell is to duplicate any other\nspell of 8th level or lower.\n\
  You don\u2019t need to meet any\nrequirements in that spell, including costly components.\n\
  The spell simply takes effect.\nAlternatively, you can create one of the following\n\
  effects of your choice:\n\u2022 You create one object of up to 25,000 gp in value\
  \ that\nisn\u2019t a m agic item.\nThe object can be no m ore than\n300 feet in\
  \ any dimension, and it appears in an unoc\xAD\ncupied space you can see on the\
  \ ground.\n\u2022 You allow up to twenty creatures that you can see to\nregain all\
  \ hit points, and you end all effects on them\ndescribed in the greater restoration\
  \ spell.\n\u2022 You grant up to ten creatures that you can see resis\xAD\ntance\
  \ to a damage type you choose.\n\u2022 You grant up to ten creatures you can see\
  \ immunity to\na single spell or other magical effect for 8 hours.\nFor\ninstance,\
  \ you could make yourself and all your com \xAD\npanions immune to a lich\u2019\
  s life drain attack.\n\u2022 You undo a single recent event by forcing a reroll\
  \ of\nany roll made within the last round (including your\nlast turn).\nReality\
  \ reshapes itself to accom m odate the\nnew result.\nFor example, a wish spell could\
  \ undo an\nopponent\u2019s successful save, a foe\u2019s critical hit, or a\nfriend\u2019\
  s failed save.\nYou can force the reroll to be made\nwith advantage or disadvantage,\
  \ and you can choose\nwhether to use the reroll or the original roll.\nYou might\
  \ be able to achieve som ething beyond the\nscope o f the above examples.\nState\
  \ your wish to the DM\nas precisely as possible.\nThe DM has great latitude in\n\
  ruling what occurs in such an instance; the greater the\nwish, the greater the likelihood\
  \ that som ething goes\nwrong.\nThis spell might simply fail, the effect you desire\n\
  might only be partly achieved, or you might suffer som e\nunforeseen consequence\
  \ as a result of how you worded\nthe wish.\nFor example, wishing that a villain\
  \ w ere dead\nmight propel you forward in time to a period when that\nvillain is\
  \ no longer alive, effectively removing you from\nthe game.\nSimilarly, wishing\
  \ for a legendary magic item\nor artifact might instantly transport you to the presence\n\
  of the item\u2019s current owner.\nThe stress of casting this spell to produce any\
  \ effect\nother than duplicating another spell w eakens you.\nAfter\nenduring that\
  \ stress, each time you cast a spell until\nyou finish a long rest, you take 1d10\
  \ necrotic damage\nper level of that spell.\nThis damage can\u2019t be reduced or\n\
  prevented in any way.\nIn addition, your Strength drops\nto 3, if it isn\u2019t\
  \ 3 or lower already, for 2d4 days.\nFor each\nof those days that you spend resting\
  \ and doing nothing\nm ore than light activity, your remaining recovery time\ndecreases\
  \ by 2 days.\nFinally, there is a 33 percent\nchance that you are unable to cast\
  \ wish ever again if you\nsuffer this stress.\nW i t c h B o l t\n1st-level evocation\n\
  Casting Time: 1 action\nRange: 30 feet\nComponents: V, S, M (a twig from a tree\
  \ that has been\nstruck by lightning)\nDuration: Concentration, up to 1 minute\n\
  A beam of crackling, blue energy lances out toward\na creature within range, form\
  \ ing a sustained arc of\nlightning between you and the target.\nMake a ranged\n\
  spell attack against that creature.\nOn a hit, the target\ntakes 1d12 lightning\
  \ damage, and on each of your turns\nfor the duration, you can use your action to\
  \ deal 1d12\nlightning damage to the target automatically.\nThe spell\nends if you\
  \ use your action to do anything else.\nThe spell\nalso ends if the target is ever\
  \ outside the spell\u2019s range or\nif it has total cover from you.\nAt Higher\
  \ Levels.\nW hen you cast this spell using\na spell slot of 2nd level or higher,\
  \ the initial damage\nincreases by 1d12 for each slot level above 1st.\nW o r d\

  \ 5 feet of you\ninstantly teleport to a previously designated sanctuary.\nYou and\
  \ any creatures that teleport with you appear in\nthe nearest unoccupied space to\
  \ the spot you designated\nwhen you prepared your sanctuary (see below).\nIf you\n\
  cast this spell without first preparing a sanctuary, the\nspell has no effect.\n\
  You must designate a sanctuary by casting this spell\nwithin a location, such as\
  \ a temple, dedicated to or\nstrongly linked to your deity.\nIf you attempt to cast\
  \ the\nspell in this manner in an area that isn\u2019t dedicated to\nyour deity,\
  \ the spell has no effect.\nW r a t h f u l S m i t e\n1st-level evocation\nCasting\

  \ to 1 minute\nThe next time you hit with a melee w eapon attack\nduring this spell\u2019\
  s duration, your attack deals an extra\n1d6 psychic damage.\nAdditionally, if the\
  \ target is a\ncreature, it must make a W isdom saving throw or be\nfrightened of\
  \ you until the spell ends.\nAs an action, the\ncreature can make a W isdom check\
  \ against your spell\nsave DC to steel its resolve and end this spell.\nZ o n e\

  \ range.\nUntil the spell ends, a creature\nthat enters the spell\u2019s area for\
  \ the first time on a turn\nor starts its turn there must make a Charisma saving\n\
  throw.\nOn a failed save, a creature can\u2019t speak a\ndeliberate lie while in\
  \ the radius.\nYou know whether\neach creature succeeds or fails on its saving throw.\n\
  An affected creature is aware o f the spell and can thus\navoid answering questions\

  \ t i v e r s e\nRELIGION IS AN IMPORTANT PART OF LIFE IN\nt h e worlds of the D&D\
  \ multiverse.\nWhen\ngods walk the world, clerics channel divine\npower, evil cults\
  \ perform dark sacrifices in\nsubterranean lairs, and shining paladins\nstand like\
  \ beacons against the darkness, it\u2019s\nhard to be ambivalent about the deities\
  \ and\ndeny their existence.\nMany people in the worlds of D&D worship different\n\
  gods at different times and circum stances.\nPeople in\nthe Forgotten Realms, for\
  \ example, might pray to Sune\nfor luck in love, make an offering to W aukeen before\n\
  heading to the market, and pray to appease Talos when\na severe storm blows in\u2014\
  all in the sam e day.\nMany\npeople have a favorite am ong the gods, one w hose\
  \ ideals\nand teachings they make their own.\nAnd a few people\ndedicate themselves\
  \ entirely to a single god, usually\nserving as a priest or champion of that god\u2019\
  s ideals.\nYour DM determines which gods, if any, are worshiped\nin his or her campaign.\n\
  From among the gods available,\nyou can choose a single deity for your character\
  \ to\nserve, worship, or pay lip service to.\nOr you can pick\na few that your character\
  \ prays to most often.\nOr just\nmake a mental note of the gods w ho are revered\
  \ in your\nDM \u2019s campaign so you can invoke their names when\nappropriate.\n\
  If you\u2019re playing a cleric or a character with\nthe Acolyte background, decide\
  \ which god your deity\nserves or served, and consider the deity\u2019s suggested\n\
  dom ains when selecting your character\u2019s domain.\nD&D P a n t h e o n s\nEach\
  \ world in the D&D multiverse has its own\npantheons of deities, ranging in size\
  \ from the teeming\npantheons of the Forgotten Realm s and Greyhawk to\nthe m ore\
  \ focused religions of Eberron and Dragonlance.\nMany of the nonhuman races worship\
  \ the sam e gods on\ndifferent w orlds\u2014Moradin, for example, is revered by\n\
  dwarves of the Forgotten Realms, Greyhawk, and many\nother worlds.\nT h e F o r\
  \ g o t t e n R e a l m s\nD ozens of deities are revered, worshiped, and feared\n\
  throughout the world of the Forgotten Realms.\nAt least\nthirty deities are widely\
  \ known across the Realms, and\nmany m ore are worshiped locally, by individual\
  \ tribes,\nsmall cults, or certain sects of larger religious temples.\nT h e L ife\
  \ a n d D e a t h D o m a i n s\nMany deities in this section suggest the Life domain,\n\
  particularly if they are closely associated with healing,\nprotection, childbirth,\
  \ nurturing, or fertility.\nAs described in\nthe chapter 3, though, the Life domain\
  \ is incredibly broad,\nand a cleric of any non-evil deity can choose it.\nA number\
  \ of other deities, mostly evil ones, suggest the\nDeath domain, which is detailed\
  \ in the Dungeon Master\u2019s\nGuide.\nMost clerics who choose this domain are\
  \ evil NPCs,\nbut if you want to worship a god of death, consult your\nDungeon Master.\n\
  G r e y h a w k\nThe gods o f Greyhawk com e from at least four different\npantheons,\
  \ representing the faiths of the various ethnic\ngroups that populated the continent\
  \ of Oerik over the\nages.\nAs a result, there\u2019s a great deal of overlap in\
  \ their\nportfolios: Pelor is the Flan god of the sun and Pholtus\nis the Oeridian\
  \ sun god, for example.\nD r a g o n l a n c e\nThe gods of the world of Krynn are\
  \ three families: seven\ngods of good headed by Paladine and Mishakal, seven of\n\
  neutrality headed by Gilean, and seven of evil headed by\nTakhisis and Sargonnas.\n\
  These deities have been called\nby many different names and held in varying levels\
  \ of\nesteem by different peoples and cultures through the\nw orld\u2019s history,\
  \ but they are the only gods of this w orld\u2014\ntheir place fixed in the stars\
  \ as constellations.\nE b e r r o n\nThe world of Eberron has many different religions,\
  \ but\nthe most important revolves around a pantheon called\nthe Sovereign Host\
  \ and their malign shadow, the Dark\nSix.\nThe gods of the Sovereign Host are thought\
  \ to have\ndom inion over every aspect of existence, and to speak\nwith a unified\
  \ voice.\nBut the Dark Six are the primitive,\nbloody, and cruel gods w ho offer\
  \ a dissenting voice.\nEberron\u2019s other religions are very different from the\n\
  traditional D&D pantheons.\nThe monotheistic Church\nof the Silver Flame is devoted\
  \ to fighting against evil in\nthe world, but plagued by corruption in its own ranks.\n\
  The philosophy of the Blood of Vol teaches that divinity\nlies within all mortal\
  \ beings and reveres the undead\nwho have secured that immortality.\nVarious mad\
  \ cults\nare devoted to the dem ons and horrors imprisoned\nin Eberron's Underdark\
  \ (called Khyber, the Dragon\nBelow).\nThe followers of the Path of Light believe\
  \ that\nthe w orld is heading toward a glorious future where\nthe shadows that cloud\
  \ this world will be transformed\ninto light.\nAnd two related nations of elves\
  \ revere their\nancestral spirits: the Undying Court, preserved as\nspirits or even\
  \ undead forms, and the glorified Spirits\nof the Past, the great heroes of ancient\
  \ wars.\nN o n h u m a n D e i t ie s\nCertain gods closely associated with nonhuman\
  \ races\nare revered on many different worlds, though not always\nin the same way.\n\
  The nonhuman races of the Forgotten\nRealm s and Greyhawk share these deities.\n\
  Nonhuman races often have whole pantheons of\ntheir own.\nBesides Moradin, for example,\
  \ the dwarf\ngods include M oradin\u2019s wife, Berronar Truesilver, and\na number\

  \ Norse pantheons are\nfantasy interpretations of historical religions from our\n\
  w orld\u2019s ancient times.\nThey include deities that are\nmost appropriate for\
  \ use in a D&D game, divorced from\ntheir historical context in the real world and\
  \ united into\npantheons that serve the needs of the game.\nT h e C e l t ic Pa\
  \ n t h e o n\nIt\u2019s said that som ething wild lurks in the heart of every\n\
  soul, a space that thrills to the sound of geese calling\nat night, to the whispering\
  \ wind through the pines, to\nthe unexpected red of mistletoe on an oak\u2014and\
  \ it is in\nthis space that the Celtic gods dwell.\nThey sprang from\nthe brook\
  \ and stream, their might heightened by the\nstrength of the oak and the beauty\
  \ of the woodlands and\nopen moor.\nW hen the first forester dared put a name to\n\
  the face seen in the bole of a tree or the voice babbling\nin a brook, these gods\
  \ forced themselves into being.\nThe Celtic gods are as often served by druids as\
  \ by\nclerics, for they are closely aligned with the forces of\nnature that druids\
  \ revere.\nT h e G r e e k Pa n t h e o n\nThe gods of Olympus make themselves known\
  \ with the\ngentle lap of waves against the shores and the crash of\nthe thunder\
  \ am ong the cloud-enshrouded peaks.\nThe\nthick boar-infested w oods and the sere,\
  \ olive-covered\nhillsides hold evidence of their passing.\nEvery aspect\nof nature\
  \ echoes with their presence, and they\u2019ve made\na place for themselves inside\
  \ the human heart, too.\nT h e E g y p t i a n Pa n t h e o n\nThese gods are a\
  \ young dynasty of an ancient divine\nfamily, heirs to the rulership of the cosm\
  \ os and the\nmaintenance of the divine principle of Ma\u2019at\u2014the\nfundamental\
  \ order of truth, justice, law, and order that\nputs gods, mortal pharaohs, and\
  \ ordinary men and\nw om en in their logical and rightful place in the universe.\n\
  The Egyptian pantheon is unusual in having three\ngods with the Death dom ain o\
  \ f different alignments.\nAnubis is the lawful neutral god of the afterlife, who\n\
  Fa n t a s y - H is t o r ic a l Pa n t h e o n s\njudges the souls of the dead.\n\
  Set is a chaotic evil god\nof murder, perhaps best known for killing his brother\n\
  Osiris.\nAnd Nephthys is a chaotic good goddess of\nmourning.\nThus, although m\
  \ ost clerics of the Death\ndomain (found in the Dungeon Master's Guide) are\nvillainous\
  \ characters, clerics w ho serve Anubis or\nNephthys need not be.\nT h e N o r s\
  \ e Pa n t h e o n\nW here the land plummets from the snowy hills into the\nicy\
  \ fjords below, where the longboats draw up on to the\nbeach, where the glaciers\
  \ flow forward and retreat with\nevery fall and spring\u2014this is the land of\
  \ the Vikings,\nthe hom e of the Norse pantheon.\nIt\u2019s a brutal clime,\nand\
  \ one that calls for brutal living.\nThe w arriors of\nthe land have had to adapt\
  \ to the harsh conditions in\norder to survive, but they haven\u2019t been too twisted\
  \ by\nthe needs of their environment.\nGiven the necessity of\nraiding for food\
  \ and wealth, it\u2019s surprising the mortals\nturned out as well as they did.\n\
  Their powers reflect\nthe need these warriors had for strong leadership and\ndecisive\
  \ action.\nThus, they see their deities in every\nbend of a river, hear them in\
  \ the crash of the thunder\nand the boom ing of the glaciers, and smell them in\
  \ the\nsm oke of a burning longhouse.\nThe Norse pantheon includes two main families,\
  \ the\nAesir (deities of war and destiny) and the Vanir (gods\nof fertility and\
  \ prosperity).\nOnce enemies, these two\nfamilies are now closely allied against\
  \ their com m on\nenemies, the giants (including the gods Surtur and\nThrym).\n\
  Like the gods of Greyhawk, gods in different\nfamilies som etim es have overlap\
  \ in their spheres of\ninfluence: Frey (of the Vanir) and Odur (of the Aesir)\n\

  \ THE COSMOS OF THE\nD u n g e o n s & D r a g o n s game, which teems\nwith a multitude\
  \ o f worlds as well as myriad\nalternate dim ensions of reality, called the planes\n\
  of existence.\nIt encom passes every world\nwhere Dungeon Masters run their adventures,\n\
  all within the relatively mundane realm of the\nMaterial Plane.\nBeyond that plane\
  \ are domains\nof raw elemental matter and energy, realm s of pure\nthought and\
  \ ethos, the hom es of dem ons and angels,\nand the dom inions of the gods.\nMany\
  \ spells and magic items can draw energy\nfrom these planes, sum m on the creatures\
  \ that dwell\nthere, com m unicate with their denizens, and allow\nadventurers to\
  \ travel there.\nAs your character achieves\ngreater power and higher levels, you\
  \ might undertake\na quest to rescue a friend from the horrific depths of\nthe Abyss,\
  \ or find yourself hoisting a tankard with the\nfriendly giants of Ysgard.\nYou\
  \ might w alk on streets\nmade of solid fire or test your mettle on a battlefield\n\
  where the fallen are resurrected with each dawn.\nT h e M a t e r ia l P l a n e\n\
  The Material Plane is the nexus where the philosophical\nand elemental forces that\
  \ define the other planes collide\nin the jum bled existence of mortal life and\
  \ mundane\nmatter.\nAll the worlds of D&D exist within the Material\nPlane, making\
  \ it the starting point for most campaigns\nand adventures.\nThe rest of the multiverse\
  \ is defined in\nrelation to the Material Plane.\nThe worlds of the Material Plane\
  \ are infinitely diverse,\nfor they reflect the creative imagination of the DMs\n\
  who set their gam es there, as well as the players w hose\nheroes adventure there.\n\
  They include magic-wasted\ndesert planets and island-dotted water worlds, worlds\n\
  where magic com bines with advanced technology and\nothers trapped in an endless\
  \ Stone Age, worlds where\nthe gods walk and places they have abandoned.\nThe best-known\
  \ worlds in the multiverse are the\nones that have been published as official campaign\n\
  settings for the D&D game over the years\u2014Greyhawk,\nBlackmoor, Dragonlance,\
  \ the Forgotten Realms,\nMystara, Birthright, Dark Sun, and Eberron, among\nothers.\n\
  Each of these worlds boasts its own cast of\nheroic adventurers and schem ing villains,\
  \ its own\nancient ruins and forgotten artifacts, its own dungeons\nand its own\
  \ dragons.\nBut if your campaign takes place\non one of these worlds, it belongs\
  \ to your DM\u2014you\nmight imagine it as one of thousands of parallel versions\n\
  of the world, which might diverge wildly from the\npublished version.\nM a t e r\
  \ i a l E c h o e s\nThe Material Plane is a richly magical place, and its\nmagical\
  \ nature is reflected in the two planes that share\nits central place in the multiverse.\n\
  The Feywild and the\nShadowfell are parallel dim ensions occupying the same\ncosm\
  \ ological space, so they are often called echo planes\nor mirror planes to the\
  \ Material Plane.\nThe w orlds and\nlandscapes of these planes mirror the natural\
  \ world\nof the Material Plane but reflect those features into\ndifferent form s\u2014\
  m ore marvelous and magical in the\nFeywild, distorted and colorless in the Shadowfell.\n\
  W here a volcano stands in the Material Plane, a\nmountain topped with skyscraper-sized\
  \ crystals that\nglow with internal fire towers in the Feywild, and a\njagged rock\
  \ outcropping resembling a skull marks the\nspot on the Shadowfell.\nThe Feywild,\
  \ also called the Plane of Faerie, is a land\nof soft lights and wonder, a country\
  \ of little people with\ngreat desires, a place of music and death.\nIt is a realm\n\
  of eternal twilight, with slow lanterns bobbing in the\ngentle breeze and huge fireflies\
  \ buzzing through groves\nand fields.\nThe sky is alight with the faded colors of\n\
  the setting, or perhaps rising, sun.\nBut, in fact, the sun\nnever truly sets or\
  \ rises; it remains stationary, dusky\nand low in the sky.\nAway from the settled\
  \ areas ruled by\nthe Seelie Court, the land is a tangle of sharp-toothed\nbrambles\
  \ and syrupy fens\u2014perfect territory for the\nUnseelie to hunt their prey.\n\
  Fey creatures, such as those\nbrought to the world by conjure woodland beings and\n\
  similar spells, dwell in the Feywild.\nThe Shadowfell, also called the Plane o f\
  \ Shadow, is\na darkly lighted dimension, a world of black and white\nwhere color\
  \ has been leached from everything.\nIt is a\nplace of toxic darkness that hates\
  \ the light, where the\nsky is a black vault with neither sun nor stars.\nP o s\
  \ i t i v e a n d N e g a t i v e P l a n e s\nLike a dome above the other planes,\
  \ the Positive Plane is the\nsource of radiant energy and the raw life force that\
  \ suffuses\nall living beings, from the puny to the sublime.\nIts dark\nreflection\
  \ is the Negative Plane, the source of necrotic energy\nthat destroys the living\
  \ and animates the undead.\nB e y o n d t h e M a t e r ia l\nBeyond the Material\
  \ Plane, the various planes of\nexistence are realm s of myth and mystery.\nThey\u2019\
  re\nnot simply other worlds, but different qualities of\nbeing, formed and governed\
  \ by spiritual and elemental\nprinciples abstracted from the ordinary world.\nP\
  \ l a n a r T r a v e l\nW hen adventurers travel into other planes of existence,\n\
  they are undertaking a legendary journey across the\nthresholds of existence to\
  \ a mythic destination where\nthey strive to complete their quest.\nSuch a journey\
  \ is the\nstuff of legend.\nBraving the realm s of the dead, seeking\nout the celestial\
  \ servants of a deity, or bargaining with\nan efreeti in its hom e city will be\
  \ the subject of song and\nstory for years to com e.\nTravel to the planes beyond\
  \ the Material Plane can be\naccom plished in two ways: by casting a spell or by\
  \ using\na planar portal.\nSpells.\nA number of spells allow direct or indirect\n\
  access to other planes of existence.\nPlane shift and\ngate can transport adventurers\
  \ directly to any other\nplane of existence, with different degrees of precision.\n\
  Etherealness allows adventurers to enter the Ethereal\nPlane and travel from there\
  \ to any of the planes it\ntouches\u2014the Shadowfell, the Feywild, or the Elemental\n\
  Planes.\nAnd the astral projection spell lets adventurers\nproject themselves into\
  \ the Astral Plane and travel to\nthe Outer Planes.\nPortals.\nA portal is a general\
  \ term for a stationary\ninterplanar connection that links a specific location\n\
  on one plane to a specific location on another.\nSom e\nportals are like doorways,\
  \ a clear window, or a fog-\nshrouded passage, and simply stepping through it\n\
  effects the interplanar travel.\nOthers are locations\u2014\ncircles of standing\
  \ stones, soaring towers, sailing ships,\nor even whole towns\u2014that exist in\
  \ multiple planes at\nonce or flicker from one plane to another in turn.\nSom e\n\
  are vortices, typically joining an Elemental Plane with a\nvery similar location\
  \ on the Material Plane, such as the\nheart of a volcano (leading to the Plane o\
  \ f Fire) or the\ndepths of the ocean (to the Plane of Water).\nT r a n s i t i\
  \ v e P l a n e s\nThe Ethereal Plane and the Astral Plane are called the\nTransitive\
  \ Planes.\nThey are mostly featureless realms\nthat serve primarily as ways to travel\
  \ from one plane\nto another.\nSpells such as etherealness and astral\nprojection\
  \ allow characters to enter these planes and\ntraverse them to reach the planes\
  \ beyond.\nThe Ethereal Plane is a misty, fog-bound dimension\nthat is som etim\
  \ es described as a great ocean.\nIts shores,\ncalled the Border Ethereal, overlap\
  \ the Material Plane\nand the Inner Planes, so that every location on those\nplanes\
  \ has a corresponding location on the Ethereal\nPlane.\nCertain creatures can see\
  \ into the Border\nEthereal, and the see invisibility and true seeing spell\ngrant\
  \ that ability.\nSom e magical effects also extend from\nthe Material Plane into\
  \ the Border Ethereal, particularly\neffects that use force energy such as forcecage\
  \ and wall\no f force.\nThe depths of the plane, the Deep Ethereal, are\na region\
  \ of swirling mists and colorful fogs.\nThe Astral Plane is the realm o f thought\
  \ and dream,\nwhere visitors travel as disem bodied souls to reach\nthe planes of\
  \ the divine and dem onic.\nIt is a great,\nsilvery sea, the sam e above and below,\
  \ with swirling\nw isps of white and gray streaking am ong motes of light\nresem\
  \ bling distant stars.\nErratic w hirlpools of color\nflicker in midair like spinning\
  \ coins.\nOccasional bits of\nsolid matter can be found here, but most of the Astral\n\
  Plane is an endless, open domain.\nI n n e r P l a n e s\nThe Inner Planes surround\
  \ and enfold the Material\nPlane and its echoes, providing the raw elemental\nsubstance\
  \ from which all the w orlds were made.\nThe\nfour Elemental Planes\u2014Air, Earth,\
  \ Fire, and Water\u2014\nform a ring around the Material Plane, suspended\nwithin\
  \ the churning Elemental Chaos.\nAt their innermost edges, where they are closest\n\
  to the Material Plane (in a conceptual if not a literal\ngeographical sense), the\
  \ four Elemental Planes\nresemble a world in the Material Plane.\nThe four\nelements\
  \ mingle together as they do in the Material\nPlane, forming land, sea, and sky.\n\
  Farther from the\nMaterial Plane, though, the Elemental Planes are both\nalien and\
  \ hostile.\nHere, the elements exist in their\npurest form\u2014great expanses of\
  \ solid earth, blazing fire,\ncrystal-clear water, and unsullied air.\nThese regions\n\
  are little-known, so when discussing the Plane of Fire,\nfor example, a speaker\
  \ usually m eans just the border\nregion.\nAt the farthest extents of the Inner\
  \ Planes,\nthe pure elements dissolve and bleed together into an\nunending tumult\
  \ of clashing energies and colliding\nsubstance, the Elemental Chaos.\nO u t e r\
  \ P l a n e s\nIf the Inner Planes are the raw matter and energy that\nmakes up\
  \ the multiverse, the Outer Planes are the\ndirection, thought and purpose for such\
  \ construction.\nAccordingly, many sages refer to the Outer Planes as\ndivine planes,\
  \ spiritual planes, or godly planes, for the\nOuter Planes are best known as the\
  \ hom es of deities.\nW hen discussing anything to do with deities, the\nlanguage\
  \ used must be highly metaphorical.\nTheir\nactual hom es are not literally \u201C\
  places\u201D at all, but\nexemplify the idea that the Outer Planes are realm s of\n\
  thought and spirit.\nAs with the Elemental Planes, one\ncan imagine the perceptible\
  \ part of the Outer Planes as\na sort of border region, while extensive spiritual\
  \ regions\nlie beyond ordinary sensory experience.\nEven in those perceptible regions,\
  \ appearances\ncan be deceptive.\nInitially, many of the Outer Planes\nappear hospitable\
  \ and familiar to natives of the\nMaterial Plane.\nBut the landscape can change\
  \ at the\nwhim s of the powerful forces that live on the Outer\nPlanes.\nThe desires\
  \ of the mighty forces that dwell on\nthese planes can remake them completely, effectively\n\
  erasing and rebuilding existence itself to better fulfill\ntheir own needs.\nDistance\
  \ is a virtually m eaningless concept on the\nOuter Planes.\nThe perceptible regions\
  \ of the planes\noften seem quite small, but they can also stretch on to\nwhat seem\
  \ s like infinity.\nIt might be possible to take\na guided tour of the Nine Hells,\
  \ from the first layer to\nthe ninth, in a single day\u2014if the powers of the\
  \ Hells\ndesire it.\nOr it could take weeks for travelers to make a\ngrueling trek\
  \ across a single layer.\nThe most well-known Outer Planes are a group of\nsixteen\
  \ planes that correspond to the eight alignments\n(excluding neutrality) and the\
  \ shades of distinction\nbetween them.\nO u t e r P l a n e s\nOuter Plane\nAlignment\n\

  \ dwell in the\nLower Planes.\nA plane\u2019s alignment is its essence, and\na character\
  \ w hose alignment doesn\u2019t match the plane\u2019s\nexperiences a profound sense\
  \ of dissonance there.\nW hen a good creature visits Elysium, for example, it\n\
  feels in tune with the plane, but an evil creature feels\nout o f tune and m ore\
  \ than a little uncomfortable.\nO t h e r P l a n e s\nExisting som ehow between\
  \ or beyond the known planes\nof existence are a variety of other realms.\nS i g\
  \ i l a n d t h e O u t l a n d s\nThe Outlands is the plane between the Outer Planes,\
  \ a\nplane of neutrality, but not the neutrality of nothingness.\nInstead it incorporates\
  \ a little of everything, keeping it\nall in a paradoxical balance\u2014simultaneously\
  \ concordant\nand in opposition.\nIt is a broad region of varied terrain,\nwith\
  \ open prairies, towering mountains, and twisting,\nshallow rivers, strongly resembling\
  \ an ordinary world\nof the Material Plane.\nThe Outlands is circular, like a great\
  \ w heel\u2014in fact,\nthose w ho envision the Outer Planes as a wheel point\n\
  to the Outlands as proof, calling it a m icrocosm of the\nplanes.\nThat argument\
  \ might be circular, however,\nfor it is possible that the arrangement of the Outlands\n\
  inspired the idea of the Great W heel in the first place.\nAround the outside edge\
  \ of the circle, evenly spaced,\nare the gate-towns: sixteen settlements, each built\n\
  around a portal leading to one o f the Outer Planes.\nEach\ntown shares many of\
  \ the characteristics of the plane\nwhere its gate leads.\nAt the center of the\
  \ Outlands, like the axle of the\nplanar wheel, the Spire shoots im possibly high\
  \ into the\nsky.\nAbove this thin peak floats the ring-shaped city of\nSigil, the\
  \ City of Doors.\nThis bustling planar m etropolis\nholds countless portals to other\
  \ planes and worlds.\nSigil is a trader\u2019s city.\nG oods, merchandise, and\n\
  information com e to it from across the planes.\nThere\nis a brisk trade in information\
  \ about the planes, in\nparticular in the com m and words or items required for\n\
  the operation of particular portals.\nThese portal keys\nare highly sought after,\
  \ and many travelers within the\ncity are looking for a particular portal or a portal\
  \ key\nto allow them to continue on their way.\nD e m i p l a n e s\nDemiplanes\
  \ are small extradimensional spaces with\ntheir own unique rules.\nThey are pieces\
  \ of reality that\ndon\u2019t seem to fit anywhere else.\nDemiplanes com e\ninto\
  \ being by a variety o f means.\nSom e are created by\nspells, such as demiplane,\
  \ or generated at the desire of a\npowerful deity or other force.\nThey may exist\
  \ naturally,\nas a fold o f existing reality that has been pinched off\nfrom the\
  \ rest of the multiverse, or as a baby universe\ngrowing in power.\nA given demiplane\
  \ can be entered\nthrough a single point where it touches another plane.\nTheoretically,\
  \ a plane shift spell can also carry travelers\nto a demiplane, but the proper frequency\
  \ required\nfor the tuning fork is extremely hard to acquire.\nThe\ngate spell is\
  \ m ore reliable, assum ing the caster knows\nof the demiplane.\nT h e Fa r R e\

  \ entirely separate multiverse with its own\nphysical and magical laws.\nW here\
  \ stray energies from\nthe Far Realm leak onto another plane, life and matter\n\
  are warped and twisted into alien shapes that defy\nordinary geometry and biology.\n\

  For mortals, knowledge\nof the Far Realm is a triumph of mind over the rude\nboundaries\
